<p><strong>Conflict of interest:</strong> DW has acted as an expert witness or consultant in several legal cases related to parental authority regarding COVID-19 vaccines or their mandatory use.</p>
<p><strong>Data availability:</strong> This is a review of the published medical and scientific literature, including regulatory documents released publicly of through FOIA requests.</p>
<div class="abstract"><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> BSTRACT</strong></p></div>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>On December 6, 2023, Florida Surgeon General Ladapo wrote to the then FDA Commissioner and CDC Director Cohen of CDC, raising concerns about the COVID-19 pro-vaccines, particularly related to DNA contamination and the presence, in the Pfizer product, of an SV40 promotor-enhancer-ori sequence. These findings were confirmed by a number of labs, by regulators, or documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. </p>
<p>A response was furnished by FDA, which formed the basis for subsequent responses to questions regarding DNA contamination and other manufacturing and safety testing issues, including frameshift proteins.</p>
<p><strong>Method</strong></p>
<p>This document is written in the form of a point-by-point critique to this response, with several additional issues identified. Along with explanatory text, this document contains 248 questions to FDA.</p>
<p><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<p>The safety standard for an EUA requires that <em>“the known and potential benefits of the product, […] outweigh </em>[its]<em> known and potential </em><em>risks.</em>“ Uncertainties, irregularities, or deviations from normal accepted practice in the manufacturing process represent “potential risks” FDA was required to consider. It was not necessary to prove that DNA contamination, the SV40 sequence, or frameshifted proteins did caused harm, the mere fact of these phenomena constituted an uninvestigated potential risk FDA was legally required to consider when granting the EUAs.</p>
<p>Given the rapid launch of the COVID-19 pro-vaccines, manufacturing and safety testing standards needed to be tightened, not loosened as described here, adding potential, if not actual risk.</p>
<p>Generous interpretation of various guidelines, and the word “expects” has been used by both sponsors and regulators  to justify why a certain test should not be done or a safeguard implemented, without providing detailed justification supporting the assertion.</p>
<p>We detail a number of inconsistencies with statements made by regulators and data obtained from public records, in one case we found an instance of an undeclared (by regulators) genotoxicity study. </p>
<p>The developmental and regulatory failure that the findings related to residual DNA and frameshift proteins represent, are hardly evidence that these modRNA vaccines meet “<em>rigorous scientific standards,” </em>and will no doubt erode further the trust in public health institutions. </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>We hope that our questions will allow us to understand the potential harms associated with the modRNA pro-vaccines in a way that begins to restore the public trust in the scientific process and health institutions, by engaging in a process of introspection and improvement of regulatory processes and decision-making.</p>
<p>These expedited and still experimental vaccines are the most complicated medical products ever deployed. Pfizer’s recently retired head of vaccine research, Dr. Kathrin Jansen, was quoted in Nature as saying <em>““We flew the </em><em>aeroplane</em><em> while we were still building it.” </em>It is now time to ground the plane pending the answers to these, and no doubt, many more questions.</p>

<h1 id="introduction"><span class="underline"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></h1>
<p>On December 6, 2023, Florida Surgeon General Ladapo wrote (1) to the then FDA Commissioner Califf and CDC Director Cohen, raising concerns about the COVID-19 pro-vaccines, particularly related to DNA contamination and the presence, in the Pfizer product, of an SV40 promotor-enhancer-ori sequence, reported originally by McKernan et al. (2) and expanded upon in a then recent preprint.(3)</p>
<p>A response was furnished on December 14, 2023, (4) by then CBER Director Marks. Rather than allaying his concerns, Dr. Ladapo believed that this response served only to heighten them, prompting Dr, Ladapo to call for a halt in the use of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines.(5)</p>
<p>Dr. Marks’ response has formed the basis for subsequent responses to questions regarding DNA contamination since then, despite the confirmation of findings of DNA contamination that exceeded guidelines, and the presence of the SV40 sequences in the Pfizer product. This confirmation has been furnished by laboratories around the world (6-10) and, notably, by high school intern students working under FDA supervision.(11) Further, in numerous FOIA disclosures around the world, regulators have confirmed the presence of the SV40 sequence (including the Marks response (4) ) and the fact that Pfizer had chosen not to specifically disclose this regulatory sequence. Our own unpublished work has confirmed this with the Pfizer 2024-2025 JN.1 formula.</p>
<p>Since the Marks response has formed the basis for FDA’s position on this topic, this document is written in the form of a point-by-point challenge, along with additional points related to safety testing or manufacturing of these products.</p>
<p>Comments are provided on a consolidated point-by-point basis, raising questions in text and provided in list format the end of this document. While FDA is not bound by the actions of regulatory agencies in other countries, by FDA’s citing WHO guidelines as well as <em>“internationally agreed upon recommendations”</em> (4) we are justified in also citing the deliberations of other regulators to inform our expectations of FDA’s actions. Further, in many instances, FDA staff have played a major role in the drafting of various WHO guidelines.</p>
<p>The term pro-vaccine is used here. Unlike conventional vaccines, the modRNA products do not contain target antigens. Rather they contain the genetic instructions that are read by a patient’s body to produce the target spike protein antigen. This is somewhat analogous to the activation of pro-drugs, molecules that lack the desired pharmacologic action, but that are converted by the body to an active form.(12) We employ the term “pro-vaccine” (13,14) to signify this important distinction, which again has regulatory consequences.</p>

<h1 id="off-label-claims-related-to-serious-outcomes"><span class="underline"><strong>Off-label claims related to </strong></span><span class="underline"><strong>serious outcomes</strong></span></h1>
<p>Dr. Marks states: <em>“Given the dramatic reduction in the risk of death, hospitalization and serious illness afforded by the vaccines, lower vaccine uptake is contributing to the continued death and serious illness toll of COVID-19.”</em></p>
<p>The indications stated at the time of Dr. Marks’ response in the package inserts for COMIRNATY and SPIKEVAX read:</p>
<p><em>“COMIRNATY is a vaccine indicated for active immunization to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 12 years of age and older.”</em> (15) (and more recently (16) )</p>
<p><em>“SPIKEVAX is a vaccine indicated for active immunization to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 12 years of age and older.”</em> (17) (and more recently (18))</p>

<div class="question" id="q6">
<a href="#q6"><strong>Question 6:</strong></a> Question 6: Please advise whether, in the absence of data meeting the “substantial evidence” standard as well as authorization by FDA of a labeling change to include a claim that the vaccine reduces “the risk of death, hospitalization and serious illness” of COVID-19 disease, manufacturers making such a claim would be in violation of statues and regulations regarding off-label promotion? How is your answer influenced by FDA’s draft guidance on Scientific Information on Unapproved Uses (SIUU)? (22)
</div>
<div class="question" id="q7">
<a href="#q7"><strong>Question 7:</strong></a> Question 7: What is the regulatory status of Dr. Marks’ (4) statement regarding a “dramatic reduction in the risk of death, hospitalization and serious illness afforded by the vaccines”? Coming from Dr. Marks, a senior FDA official, does this represent an amendment to the approved labeling, a regulatory guidance, an enforcement policy, SIUU, or personal medical opinion? 
</div>
<p>FDA’s draft guidance on SIUU (22) recommends that in order, inter alia, to facilitate a firm’s obligations to ensure that FDA-required labeling accurately reflects “what is known about the safety profile of the drug,” “to ensure that the FDA-required labeling is not false or misleading,” and to dispel the notion of a “firm’s intent that the medical product be used for an unapproved use,” (p6/29) sponsors providing SIUU should include, inter alia, “A statement that the unapproved use(s) of the medical product has not been approved by FDA and that the safety and effectiveness of the medical product for the unapproved use(s) has not been established.” (p16/29) </p>
<p>If these sorts of safeguards on the dissemination of SIUU apply to sponsors, who by virtue of their commercial interests, would be suspected by the medical and lay community of what FDA calls “persuasive marketing techniques” (p18/29 in (22)), then at least similar safeguards and the principles they embody should exist in the case of government health agencies about whom there would be no suspicion.</p>
<div class="question" id="q8">
<a href="#q8"><strong>Question 8:</strong></a> Question 8: Although this draft guidance applies to sponsors, given Dr. Marks’ statement concerning a “dramatic reduction in the risk of death, hospitalization and serious illness afforded by the vaccines,” and the absence of the corresponding claim in the package insert, is it FDA’s intent that the modRNA COVID-19 vaccines be used to reduce these serious outcomes?
</div>
<div class="question" id="q9">
<a href="#q9"><strong>Question 9:</strong></a> Question 9: Per Question 8, if it is FDA’s intent that the COVID-19 vaccines be used to reduce serious outcomes, would the issuance of such a statement on this use by FDA without the qualifying language concerning this unapproved use, misleadingly imply that this use had been approved by FDA?

<p>This page linked to the CDC page cited above (25) as well as another CDC page (27) which described the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines not as “safe and effective” as above  but only in terms of a <em>“growing body of evidence … </em><em>that the benefits of vaccination outweigh any potential risks of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy:”</em></p>
<p><em>“Staying </em><em> with COVID-19 vaccinations is recommended for </em><em>, trying to get pregnant now, or who might become pregnant in the future, and people who are breastfeeding. </em><em> on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination indicates that the benefits of vaccination outweigh any potential risks of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy.”</em><em> </em>(original links preserved)</p>

<p>There is no language in this video or in the description provided on the YouTube site to alert the viewer to the language cited above appearing in the package inserts for the Pfizer and Moderna products.</p>
<p>To an unprofessional eye, FDA’s video appears well-produced with clear dialog, engaging graphics and an upbeat soundtrack. It is one of a series of over 40 short videos addressing mainly COVID-19 related topics and titled “Just a minute with Dr. Peter Marks.” The series, as its title indicates, develops a celebrity-like status for its featured interlocutor, a senior FDA official, as a means to add authority and credibility to the message, in this case FDA’s endorsement of a CDC recommendation concerning the use of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy and lactation.</p>
<p>FDA’s recent draft guidance on SIUU (p18/29 in (22)) cited in preface to Question 8 frowns upon the use by sponsors to disseminate SIUU using “persuasive marketing techniques” that could include “the use of celebrity endorsements.” The effective creation and deployment of the Director of CBER as a celebrity persona to endorse CDC’s recommendation for a use characterized by the label as having insufficient data, heightens the concerns expressed in my preface to Question 8 that government agencies have a higher duty to conform to the principles embodied in FDA’s draft guidance on the dissemination of SIUU.</p>

The safety and immunogenicity of prophylactic BNT162b2 in individuals 16 to 55 years of age vaccinated with </em><em>“</em><em>Process 1</em><em>”</em><em> and </em><em>each lot of “Process 2” study intervention will be </em><em>described</em><em>. A random sample of 250 participants from those vaccinated with study intervention by manufacturing “Process 1” will be selected for this descriptive analysis.”</em></p>
<p>It is now public knowledge that Pfizer’s Process 1 used a DNA template generated by a PCR method, with likely minimal plasmid involvement. Switching to a plasmid – <em>E. coli</em>-based Process 2 similar to the one used by Moderna introduced the possibility of a very different profile of potential impurities and contaminants. These included the starting burden of residual DNA as a process related impurity, the types of DNA (e.g. plasmid sequence elements such as promoters, enhancers, and antibiotic resistance genes), and DNA and endotoxin contaminants from the <em>E. coli</em>. Certainly EMA in their February 19 2021 assessment of the Pfizer product noted (p16/140) that this change <em>“may result in a different impurity profile in the active substance”</em> (30) The <em>“comparability between clinical and commercial material” </em>(p31/140)<em>, </em>along with other issues were the subject of Major Objections (MOs) that would have precluded authorization.</p>
<p>These sorts of process changes introduced a new risk profile to the drug product, that in non-pandemic circumstances would have triggered at least a risk assessment, and possibly an appropriately sized clinical comparability study. FDA’s own guidance entitled <em>“Q5E Comparability of Biotechnological/Biological Products Subject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process”</em> (31) instructively provides some general principles by which comparability should be determined (emphasis added):</p>
<p><em>“A determination of comparability can be based on a combination of analytical testing, biological assays, and, in some cases, nonclinical and clinical data. If a manufacturer can provide assurance of comparability through analytical studies alone, </em><em>nonclinical</em><em> or clinical studies with the </em><em>postchange</em><em> product are not warranted. However, </em><em><strong>where the relationship between specific quality attributes and safety and efficacy has not been established</strong></em><em>, and differences between quality attributes of the pre- and </em><em>postchange</em><em> product are observed, it might be appropriate to include a combination of quality, nonclinical, and/or clinical studies in the comparability exercise.”</em></p>
<p>The emboldened clause certainly applies to the modRNA vaccines. Given the necessity for clinical data, to estimate the size of such a study, FDA’s June 2020 guidance <em>“Development and Licensure of Vaccines to Prevent COVID-19”</em> (32) is instructive: <em>“The pre-licensure safety database for preventive vaccines for infectious diseases typically consists of at least 3,000 study participants vaccinated with the dosing regimen intended for licensure.”</em></p>
<p>This is a far cry from an analysis that is merely “<em>exploratory</em>,” <em>“descriptive”</em> and involves only 250 subjects per arm. Perhaps the discrepancy reflects FDA’s switch from the BLA approach described in the June 2020 guidance (32) to an EUA approach in the October guidance.(33) This switch lowered the evidentiary bar from the BLA standard of <em>“</em><em>established as </em><em>safe and effective”</em> based on <em>“substantial evidence” “consisting of adequate and well-controlled investigations.” </em>to the EUA standard of <em>“</em><em>believes </em><em>may be effective”</em> based on a <em>“totality of evidence” </em>not requiring clinical studies at all.</p>
<p>Further, an inadequately characterized manufacturing change may have fallen foul of cGMP. This may have been circumvented since. in a public health emergency, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services may <em>“</em><em>authorize, with respect to an eligible product, deviations from current good manufacturing practice requirements</em><em>.”</em>  (34) This seems also to have been the approach of EMA who issued a time-limited exemption regarding certain GMP issues that were the subject of Major Objections. This exemption, along with data submitted by Pfizer and the imposition of time-bound “Specific Obligations” (binding conditions to the authorization)<em><strong> </strong></em>and “Recommendations” (not binding but important considerations for future development) allowed EMA to lift the Major Objections and issue its Conditional Market Authorization “<em>In view of the declared Public Health Emergency of International Concern</em><em>.</em><em>”</em> (p32/140 in (30))</p>
<p>If the Secretary of HHS did issue such a waiver covering matters relating to this sort of process change, VRBPAC members do not appear to have been fully informed either at the meeting of December 10, or the meeting of October 22, 2020 which introduced the EUA framework. FDA’s Dr. Jerry Weir described some of the differences between the cGMP requirements for full (BLA) licensure and the “expectations” under EUA. With the main differences relating to stability and lot release testing, Dr. Weir explained that FDA expected complete details and validation of the manufacturing process,(35) further stating that “<em>T</em><em>he</em><em> </em><em>CMC</em><em> </em><em>expectations are very similar for EUA use or licensure.</em><em>” </em>(p201/408 of transcript (36)).</p>
<p>Given these representations, the fact of this critical manufacturing change as well as the details of proposed post-authorization requirements or undertakings would be significant components of the “totality of scientific evidence available” VRBPAC was asked to consider when answering FDA’s voting question on December 10, 2020 as to whether or not <em>“the benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine outweigh its risks for use in individuals 16 years of age and older?”</em></p>

<p>The absence of this information compromises VRBPAC’s ability to assess the benefits and risks associated with the manufacturing change, impugning the integrity and validity of their vote.</p>
<p>Guetzkow and Levi documented Pfizer’s manufacturing changes, relative to the clinical trial and public distribution batches in a Rapid Response published in the British Medical Journal.(37) They described differences in the numbers of adverse events reported to VAERS with various batches and highlighted the “the importance of publicly disclosing the analysis comparing reactogenicity and safety of process 1 and 2 batches as specified in the trial protocol.”</p>

<p>Information about the Process 1 to Process 2 change has been more forthcoming from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) than FDA. In its Assessment Report dated February 19 2021,(30) EMA (p34/140) notes the need to demonstrate the biological, chemical and physical comparability of Drug Substance (DS) and Drug Product (DP) produced by the two processes.</p>
<p><em>“</em><em>The commercial batches are produced using a different process (Process 2), and the comparability of these processes relies on demonstration of comparable biological, chemical and physical characteristics of the active substance and finished product.</em><em>”</em></p>
<p>In relation to this and other issues, EMA (p137/140) determined that <em>“Given the emergency situation, it is considered that the identified uncertainties can be addressed post-</em><em>authorisation</em><em> in the context of a conditional MA </em>[marketing authorization],” expecting the descriptive comparability analysis of clinical data in February 2021 ( p69/140).</p>
<p>A heavily redacted comparability report involving bench-top analytical and limited in vitro testing dated March 2021 was released by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in June 2022. (39) However the fate of the clinical descriptive study was not known publicly until the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency’s (MHRA) provided a response to FOI request 23/510.(40)</p>
<p>MHRA explained the need for the descriptive clinical study a little differently from EMA. (30)</p>
<p><em>“</em><em>Typically, such changes can be supported by analytical data; however, due to the nascent regulatory landscape for COVID-19 vaccines, in October 2020 an exploratory objective was added in the C4591001 study to describe safety and immunogenicity of vaccines produced by manufacturing “Process 1” or “Process </em><em>2” </em><em> </em>[…]<em>”</em></p>
<p>Shockingly, MHRA revealed that <em>“this process comparison was not conducted as part of the formal documentation within the protocol amendment.”</em> The study objective that had been added in Amendment 7 in October 2020, had, according to MHRA, been removed in amendment 20 in September 2022 <em>“</em><em>due to the extensive usage of vaccines manufactured via “Process 2</em><em>.</em><em>”</em><em> </em><em>“</em></p>

<p>Although, as mentioned above, EMA in their February 2021 assessment decided that, given the emergency situation, a number of uncertainties would be addressed after issuing a conditional authorization. (30) While EMA determined that comparability between the two processes had been adequately demonstrated, several matters remained sufficiently concerning to impose “Specific Obligations” in addition to a number of “Recommendations.” Although some matters were later considered resolved by EMA, with some detail being published by Pfizer, (42) this is by no means settled science and their reexamination is warranted in light of recent findings concerning plasmid-derived DNA (section ‎5), frameshift proteins (section ‎14) and lipid nanoparticles, lipid adducts (section ‎8) discussed below.</p>
<p>Pertinent to this discussion of DNA and RNA, EMA had questions, Specific Obligations (<strong>SO</strong>) or Recommendations (<strong>REC</strong>) (p36/140) related to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SO1: </strong>the poly(A) tail pattern (p19/140)</li>
<li><strong>SO1: </strong>the 5’ cap (p18/140)</li>
<li><strong>SO2</strong><strong>, REC8</strong><strong>: </strong>mRNA integrity and dsRNA (pp21, 17/140)</li>
<li><strong>SO1: </strong>differences in the pattern and identity of RNA species revealed by electropherogram (p18/140)</li>
<li>Although EMA considered fragmented and truncated RNA unlikely to result in expressed proteins, EMA observed that the lack of experimental data did not permit a definitive conclusion. EMA noted (p137/140): <em>“The high levels of these impurities reflect the instability of RNA resulting in generation of RNA fragments both in the transcription step and thereafter.”</em></li>
<li><strong>SO1: </strong>the identity and molecular weights of bands of expressed proteins observed in Western Blots; accounting for glycosylation as a source of discrepancies in molecular weight estimates from Western Blots. (p19/140)</li>
<li><strong>SO3:</strong> confirm the consistency of the finished product (commercial scale) manufacturing process (p36/140)</li>
<li><strong>REC3:</strong> Implementation of analytical methods for release testing of enzymes used in the manufacturing process. (p16/140)</li>
<li><strong>REC4</strong>: Reassessment of the specification for linear DNA template purity and impurities.</li>
<li><strong>REC7</strong>: The robustness of the DNase digestion step for the control of residual DNA impurities in DS, EMA noted the ongoing studies on this topic. (p17/140)</li>
<li><strong>REC10</strong>: Suitable assay for biological characterization of protein expression for the active substance (p20/140)</li>
</ul>
<div class="question" id="q47">

<h1 id="ema-concerns-regarding-residual-dna"><span class="underline"><strong>EMA c</strong></span><span class="underline"><strong>oncerns regarding residual DNA</strong></span></h1>
<p>Dr. Marks’ letter makes two statements concerning the removal of residual DNA:</p>
<p>“As part of the purification process during production, the mRNA is treated with DNAse to digest residual DNA.”</p>
<p>“The treatment of the products with DNAase also fragments any residual DNA template that might be present after other manufacturing steps.”</p>
<p>No doubt these statements were intended to allay concerns about residual DNA. Dr. Marks’ letter fails to acknowledge that concerns persisted about residual DNA and the DNase digestion step, well past Pfizer’s 2020 EUA and 2021 BLA as revealed in EMA documents.</p>
<p>Reports relating to most of EMA’s Specific Obligations (SO) were to be submitted by March 2021. SO3 as well as three (3, 4, 7) of the recommendations from EMA’s February 2021 assessment (30) listed above related in whole or part to various aspects of the DNA template or residual DNA. Two documents released recently pursuant to the European public access regulations (ASK-148075, October 25, 2023) suggest that residual DNA had remained an ongoing issue even to June 2022.</p>
<p>Below are two screen shots from the first of these redacted documents, <em>“</em><em>CHMP Assessment Report for the Post-</em><em>Authorisation</em><em> Measure REC 027, Comirnaty</em><em>”</em> submitted March 2021 with conclusions adopted May 2021 (43) The redactions are original to the EMA documents as disclosed.</p>
<div class="image-container">
<img src="WisemanGutschi2025FDAIntrospection091325_images/image9.png" alt="Document image image9.png" />
</div>
<p>In the context of the third sentence of this first screenshot that begins “As a mitigation approach…” and discusses the robustness of the DNase digestion step, the second word of the paragraph, which, following the word “An,” must begin with a vowel, appears to be ”excess,” “elevation,” or similar.</p>
<p>This is consistent with an unredacted document dated November 25 2020 “Rapporteur’s Rolling Review assessment report Overview and list of questions. Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/005735/RR.” that states:</p>
<p><em>&quot;Residual DNA template is present at higher level in</em><em> </em><em>PPQ3</em><em><strong> </strong></em><em>batch (211 ng DNA / mg RNA) than in PPQ1 and PQ2 batches (10 and 23 ng/mg); the robustness of DNase I digestion step should be further investigated.&quot;</em><em> </em>(p16/78)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p><em>“No validation data are available to confirm consistent removal of impurities, which is not acceptable. In addition, residual DNA template is present at higher level in PPQ3 batch (211 ng DNA / mg RNA) than in PPQ1 and PPQ2 batches (10 and 23 ng/mg) which does not confirm the robustness of DNase I digestion.” </em>(p58/78)</p>
<p>This document is among those leaked in December 2020 to several journalists (44) and the BMJ.<sup> </sup>(45) Given their use by the BMJ, the passage of three years in which the authenticity of the documents could have been challenged, as well as consistency with other documents of known provenance, this document is likely authentic.</p>
<p>A second screen shot refers to Recommendation 3 (release testing of enzymes used in the manufacturing process) directly and as a “request” with time frame of 2Q2021.</p>
<div class="image-container">
<img src="WisemanGutschi2025FDAIntrospection091325_images/image10.png" alt="Document image image10.png" />
</div>
<p>The words “robustness of the DNase digestion step” is a reference to Recommendation 7. As in the earlier screen shot, the first redaction appears to signal “excess” or similar, or perhaps “variable” or similar. The second redaction appears to be referring to some quality deficiency in the DNase leading to concerning residual DNA levels.</p>
<p>The second document released pursuant to European public access regulations (ASK-148075) is titled <em>“</em><em>CHMP Type IB variation report, Comirnaty</em><em>.</em><em>”</em> (46) The document relates to an application by Pfizer made on January 24 2022 to, inter alia, implement test procedures to qualify DNase used in manufacturing, stemming from Recommendations 3 and 7, to improve the robustness of the DNase digestion step, and therefore result in consistently and acceptably lower levels of residual DNA.</p>
<p>As shown in the screenshots below, the goal of each recommendation was only partly fulfilled. A revised submission was planned for June 2022.</p>

<p>What is most concerning is that some 18 months (at least) after the Pfizer EUA was issued, and about nine months after the COMINARTY BLA was approved, issues with residual DNA still remained.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-gmp-like"><span class="underline"><strong>What is “</strong></span><span class="underline"><strong>GMP-like”</strong></span><span class="underline"><strong>?</strong></span></h1>
<p>Dr. Marks makes two statements that reference the manufacturing process:</p>
<p>“We would like to make clear that based on a thorough assessment of the entire manufacturing process, FDA is confident in the quality, safety, and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines.”</p>
<p>“FDA takes its responsibility for ensuring the safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality of all vaccines licensed in the U.S., including the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, very seriously.”</p>
<p>A (June 21 2023) webinar hosted by the USP entitled “Quality Considerations for Plasmid DNA as a Starting Material for Cell and Gene Therapies” included a presentation by Lawrence Thompson,<strong> </strong>Associate Research Fellow, Pfizer, and a member of the USP Expert Panel to develop a USP general chapter on “manufacturing and testing of plasmid DNA used as a starting material in the manufacturing of CGT / mRNA products.”</p>
<p>Mr. Thompson discussed the quality of plasmids used in manufacture: </p>
<p>“Then around 2015, we started moving into the gene therapy area, specifically aav gene therapy. And we started working with suppliers who had materials, and they were calling them GMP-like materials, all right, this is sort of a brand new thing that started to pop up. It&#x27;s not research grade, it&#x27;s not GMP. What does GMP like even mean? We could talk about that a little more in the discussion section where they have some controls and you need to have some oversight of that. What&#x27;s the quality of that material? You&#x27;re going to take a lot of time with supplier knowledge and scientific justification to sort of figure that out. This is when we were working with supplier. Then we started moving internally and making our own stuff, and we had a mix of these different materials. Again, there was a lot of phase-appropriate scientific justification, a lot of discussions about that for this, again, for the gene therapy.

<h1 id="prior-downgrading-of-integration-risk-for-residual"><span class="underline"><strong>Prior downgrading of integration risk for residual DNA</strong></span></h1>
<p>Dr. Marks’ non-concern for an integration risk of residual DNA perhaps reflects comments in a 2021 version (48) of the 2007 WHO (49) document addressing DNA vaccines positing that “prior concerns about integration, autoimmunity and immunopathology have not been borne out” and speculating that “the observed reactogenicity appears to relate more to the delivery method than to the DNA vaccine itself, most notably in the case of electroporation or particle-mediated bombardment.” (p14/54) </p>
<p>The downgrading of integration risk has evolved over many years. The 2013 WHO Recommendation document regarding cell substrates for biological products (50) provides an interesting historical perspective on risk assessment related to residual DNA. (p8/110)</p>
<p>In the 1970’s as a result of a clinical research need, interferon alpha (IFN-α) was produced in a tumor line whose cells contained the Epstein-Barr virus genome. With a concern that viral DNA could be transmitted in whole or part to patients, regulatory agencies in several countries authorized human clinical studies and eventually approved an IFN-α product. Contributing to those decisions and the risk-benefit consideration was the fact that the product was being used for therapeutic rather than prophylactic purposes, and that a validated purification process along with assays that could show that DNA was undetectable within the assay limits.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the same document (50) acknowledged and reviewed the risk of residual DNA en passant (p22/110), citing several papers.(51-55) One particular paper cited, written in 1995 by Petricciani and Horaud (56) is remarkable in that its authors appear to hold, simultaneously contradictory positions that approximate to those at the heart of our current discord. </p>
<p>On the one hand Petricciani and Horaud view DNA and its threats in biologic products in terms of “DNA dragons,” stating that “many of us believe that we can now see the DNA dragons for what they are: real myths.” </p>
<p>On the other hand, this expression of “belief” appears tempered by its sandwiching between more factual descriptions of the state of science on this topic. This declaration of belief seems to have been precipitated by work bemoaningly cited as demonstrating that an inefficient extraction procedure grossly underestimated the amount of DNA in a biological sample, with the assertion, appropriately, that “if tests for DNA are to be required, the results should be meaningful rather than fanciful. In other words, the numerical values reported should not be presented simply to provide comfort to regulatory authorities that risk has been reduced, but they should have scientific credibility and be biologically meaningful.”</p>
<p>Petricciani and Horaud concede that “Nevertheless, it also is clear that more needs to be done to achieve a final resolution of the DNA issue. Complex problems are not solved easily or quickly, especially when there is an emotional element overlaid onto scientific issues.” They call for an international group with broad regulatory, industrial, and academic representation to answer questions, including:</p>
<p>“Is residual cellular DNA a practical and realistic risk, or simply a theoretical concern?</p>
<p>What range of cellular DNA levels should be considered essentially risk-free?</p>
<p>What levels of cellular DNA should be considered acceptable as an impurity in biological products?”</p>
<p>In the span of some 30 years and with advances in modRNA and lipid nanoparticle technology, these questions remain as relevant today as in 1995. Most concerning is that Petricciani and Horaud’s motivation in calling for an international group appears to reach a foregone conclusion (theirs) rather than conduct healthy scientific discourse or consider opposing arguments:</p>
<p>“The time is long overdue for sanity to return to the issue of residual cellular DNA in biological products, and for DNA to be treated as a simple impurity rather than as a monster. A conference such as the one proposed above would provide a mechanism to achieve that goal.”</p>
<p>Petricciani and Horaud may well have been correct in their assessment of risks associated with residual DNA resulting from the vaccine technology of the 1990s. But while technology has progressed with innovations in modRNA and LNPs over 30 years, we have not progressed in our ability to grapple with “[c]omplex problems [that] are not solved easily or quickly, especially when there is an emotional element overlaid onto scientific issues.” The time is indeed “long overdue for sanity to return to the issue of residual [cellular] DNA” and that FDA’s detailed answers to the detailed questions posed here, devoid of over-simplification, obfuscation, and thinly veiled accusations of misinformation, will “provide a mechanism to achieve that goal.”</p>

<p>Dr. Marks’ letter makes two statements concerning the plausibility of chromosomal integration of residual DNA, arguing that since access to the nucleus is unlikely, integration is even less likely:</p>
<p>“On first principle, it is quite implausible that the residual small DNA fragments located in the cytosol could find their way into the nucleus through the nuclear membrane present in intact cells and then be incorporated into chromosomal DNA.” (his footnote 2 citing (57))</p>
<p>“Regarding concern for possible integration of the residual DNA fragments into reproductive cells: Please see the response to the first question above regarding the implausibility that the minute amounts of small DNA fragments present could find their way into the nucleus of these cells.”</p>
<p>These assertions of the implausibility of genomic insertion by residual DNA rely solely on the one reference cite by Dr. Marks as footnote 2 (57), a chapter in a textbook by Cooper, “The Cell: A Molecular Approach.”  The author’s preface reads (emphasis added):</p>
<p>“The goals and distinguishing features of The Cell, however, remain unchanged from the first edition. The Cell continues to be a basic text that provides an accessible introduction for undergraduate or medical students who are taking a first course on cell and molecular biology.”</p>
<p>The chapter cited describes the fundamental properties of the nuclear membrane, whose properties are the basis for the assertion as to implausibility of insertion. It does not discuss the plausibility of nuclear entry or genomic insertion of residual DNA, nor would such a basic introductory undergraduate text be expected to do so. However, from the same basic text book cite by Dr. Marks, another chapter entitled “The Nucleus during Mitosis” (58) renders meaningless the suggestion of “first principle” implausibility of DNA entry by describing how the nuclear membrane breaks down during mitosis, thus plausibly providing access of residual DNA to chromosomal DNA. The chapter states:</p>
<p>“A unique feature of the nucleus is that it disassembles and re-forms each time most cells divide. At the beginning of mitosis, the chromosomes condense, the nucleolus disappears, and the nuclear envelope breaks down, resulting in the release of most of the contents of the nucleus into the cytoplasm.”</p>
<p>Dr. Marks’ statements would in fact be relevant to yeasts, as Cooper elaborates: “Some unicellular eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts) undergo so-called closed mitosis, in which the nuclear envelope remains intact.” However, as Boettcher and Barral (59) confirm, human cells undergo open mitosis.</p>

<p>Indeed, Faurez et al., (60) in discussing the biosafety of DNA vaccines and DNA entry into the nucleus, list incorporation of plasmid DNA into the nucleus “during disassembly of the nuclear membrane during mitosis” as one mechanism, alongside nuclear import by simple or facilitated diffusion through nuclear pores.</p>

<p>If true, the assertion that DNA could not plausibly even enter the nucleus lacks substance and would render any guidelines concerning residual DNA levels pointless.

<p>Any risk of integration from residual DNA must be added to the risk associated with DNA produced by reverse transcription of vaccinal modRNA. In a 2022 interview posted on FDA’s Youtube channel,  Dr. Marks was asked to comment on “the thought that vaccines can, particularly with the mRNA, alter one&#x27;s DNA.” He gave three reasons to support his statement that “there&#x27;s no way they can alter your DNA”:</p>
<p>the mRNA is destroyed</p>
<p>the RNA can&#x27;t get into the nucleus, the nucleus has a one-way valve</p>
<p>our cells do not have the enzyme necessary to get RNA back into DNA</p>
<p>These reasons mirror those given in the 2021 WHO guidelines on mRNA vaccines (71) (p47/66) to justify why: “nonclinical studies do not need to be performed to specifically address integration or genetic risks as these are considered to be theoretical issues for mRNA vaccines.” (p48/66)</p>
<p>As will be discussed, none of these arguments hold water, with evidence that these issues are more than “theoretical,” thereby raising concern and the need for studies “to specifically address integration or genetic risks.”</p>
<h1 id="the-mrna-is-destroyed"><span class="underline"><em><strong>“</strong></em></span><span class="underline"><em><strong>the</strong></em></span><span class="underline"><em><strong> mRNA is destroyed”</strong></em></span></h1>
<p>The notion is more fully expressed in the 2021 WHO guidelines on mRNA vaccines (71): “the vaccine mRNA degrades within a relatively short time once taken up by the body’s cells, as does the cell’s own mRNA. During that entire time, the mRNA vaccine is expected to remain in the cytoplasm, where it will be translated and then degraded by normal cellular mechanisms.” (p48/66)</p>
<p>Although Pfizer did not appear to conduct RNA or protein metabolism studies, a number of reports from animal or human studies have now emerged that detect vaccinal modRNA or spike protein in various tissues weeks or months after vaccination (72-77), see review in (78). Based on all of these studies, it is clear that the premise that “mRNA is destroyed” to support the argument that “there&#x27;s no way [the mRNA vaccines] can alter your DNA” is untenable and at best inconclusive.</p>
<p>Further discussion on the need for biodistribution studies including cellular kinetics of both vaccinal RNA and spike protein, is given in section ‎0.</p>
<h1 id="the-rna-cant-get-into-the-nucleus-the-nucleus-has-"><span class="underline"><em><strong>“</strong></em></span><span class="underline"><em><strong>the</strong></em></span><span class="underline"><em><strong> RNA can&#x27;t get into the nucleus, the nucleus has a one-way valve</strong></em></span><span class="underline"><em><strong>”</strong></em></span></h1>
<p>Just as nuclear membrane disassembly during mitosis provides access of residual DNA to chromosomal DNA (‎4.2), it could apply also to RNA.</p>
<p>An additional potential mechanism is suggested by Sattar whose colleagues include those from NIAID in a work entitled “Nuclear translocation of spike mRNA and protein is a novel pathogenic feature of SARS-CoV-2.” (79) They described how the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein (but not that of other coronaviruses) contains a nuclear localization signal that enables them to translocate into the nucleus in virus-infected cells. Further, they found that spike mRNA also translocates into the nucleus, colocalizing with, and aided by spike protein.</p>
<p>The premise of a “one-way valve” is subject to challenge for another reason. Citing a rich literature, Domazet-Lošo (80) has reviewed the possibility that mRNA can retropose (undergo reverse transcription to DNA with subsequent insertional mutagenesis, see below) mediated by the protein products of LINE-1. These genes are part of the family of Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements and are considered “Transposable Elements” (TE) because they can transpose from one genomic region to another, modifying its structure and acquiring the name “jumping genes.”(81) </p>
<p>Domazet-Lošo proposes the mechanism illustrated below in which some of the protein products of LINE-1 form ribonucleoprotein complexes with vaccinal mRNA, possibly facilitating its entry to the nucleus, where it can undergo retroposition.</p>
<div class="question" id="q66">
<a href="#q66"><strong>Question 66:</strong></a> Question 66: As with conventional pharmacokinetics (PK) (see ‎0Error!

<p>The 2021 WHO guideline on mRNA vaccines (71) (p47/66) expresses this premise as “The only known mechanism by which RNA can integrate into the host genome requires the presence of a complex containing reverse transcriptase and integrase.”</p>
<p>This premise is untenable given the reverse transcriptase activity of the protein products of endogenous LINE-1. In his review of retroposition, Domazet-Lošo (80) noted that in addition to the formation of ribonucleoproteins that may facilitate vaccinal modRNA entry into the nucleus, LINE-1 protein products display reverse transcriptase and endonuclease activities. (80) Based on the abundance of LINE-1, and reviewing a number of pertinent factors that could increase retroposition (N-1 methyl pseudouridylation, use of LNP, improved stability, half-life and translational efficiency), Domazet-Lošo voices an “urgent[ly] need [for] experimental studies that would rigorously test for the potential retroposition of vaccine mRNAs. At present, the insertional mutagenesis safety of mRNA-based vaccines should be considered unresolved.”</p>
<p>Further evidence (see review in (82)) for the ability of endogenous LINE-1 to effect reverse transcription, and possible insertion comes from the work led by Dr. Rudolf Jaenisch from the Whitehead Institute, MIT and the National Cancer Institute, and funded partly by NIH. (Zhang et al., (83)) Noting in their introduction, detection of non-retroviral RNA viral sequences into the genomes of many vertebrates, Zhang et al. studied cell lines and patient-derived tissues and found evidence for reverse-transcription of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and genomic integration by a LINE-1 mechanism. This could result, possibly by template switching, in the production of human-viral mRNA chimeric transcripts and raising the prospect of novel proteins.</p>
<p>In a subsequent work, the same group reported genomic integration of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA mediated by LINE-1 associated reverse transcription into human cell lines infected with virus, (84) again controverting the premise that “our cells do not have the enzyme necessary to get RNA back into DNA.” This was not observed for cells transfected with viral RNA. The authors point out a number of limitations to extrapolating their finding to conclude that this would not occur with modRNA vaccines. Firstly, these studies were performed in cell lines and not animals or humans. Secondly, their study achieved transfection using lipofectamine rather than LNPs. Thirdly, the RNA sequence in the study was nucleocapsid and not spike protein. Another important difference was in the sequences of the untranslated regions, the use of N1-methyl pseudouridine and the use of codon of optimization. The findings of Zhang et al. have been challenged, and discussed further by two of the works’ coauthors. (85)</p>
<p>Many of these limitations were absent in the paper by Alden et al., (86) who reported that BNT162b2 mRNA was reverse transcribed into DNA within six hours after human liver cell line cells were exposed to vaccine in vitro. This finding dispels another argument made by the 2021 WHO guideline on mRNA vaccines (71) to dismiss the need for integration studies: “Further, the design of candidate mRNA vaccines should be considered so that they do not include specific RNA-binding sites for primers required for the reverse transcriptase to initiate transcription.” (p47/66)</p>
<p>Alden et al. also reported that the vaccine increased distribution of LINE-1 protein in the nucleus. The effect may not be due to the primary components of the Pfizer vaccine, but rather to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a process-related impurity, as Zhang et al., (84) suggested that dsRNA, known to induce innate immune responses, could induce endogenous LINE-1 expression. They further noted “that therapeutic mRNAs should be designed to avoid unwanted dsRNA (secondary) structures.” Since dsRNA is a process-related impurity, variability between lots could contribute to variable vaccine reactions.</p>
<p>Another reason why the premise that “our cells do not have the enzyme necessary to get RNA back into DNA” is untenable because reverse transcriptase may be expressed by genes from Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs). HERVS are ancient retroviral genomic integrations estimated to account for about 8% of the human genome and possibly involved in a number of diseases including cancer, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disease.(87) HERVs related genes may be upregulated or activated by environmental factors such as viruses, including influenza A (88) and SARS-CoV-2. (89,90) These findings have implications particularly in vaccinees that have also been infected with SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<h1 id="the-need-for-integration-studies"><span class="underline"><strong>The need for i</strong></span><span class="underline"><strong>ntegration studies</strong></span></h1>
<p>As detailed, there is sufficient reason to dismiss the non-concern for the need for integration studies, both for residual DNA (‎4.2) and potentially reverse transcribed RNA (‎4.3). </p>
<p>The WHO 2007 guideline (49) for DNA vaccines is instructive. The document discusses (p18/25) the fractions of naked DNA entering cells, entering the nucleus, inserting into DNA, inserting at a key location, leading to a low probability of tumorigenesis, borne out, at least partly, in some studies. The document continues to discuss circumstances where integration studies might be required:</p>
<p>:</p>
<p>“However, alternative formulations or administration devices such as co-inoculation of a plasmid encoding a growth promoting factor, or electrostimulation, can lead to an increased potential for integration of plasmid DNA, and an investigation of the potential integration of the plasmid DNA in vivo into the host’s chromosomes should form part of the nonclinical safety testing of a DNA vaccine. </p>
<p>Integration studies may not be necessary for a plasmid DNA vaccine if prior information on a similar plasmid, with the same mode of administration already exists. There would be a need to reassess integration if there was a significant change in the method of delivery, especially any change potentially involving an increase in the capacity of plasmid DNA to enter the nucleus.” (emphasis added) </p>
<p>The use of LNPs certainly increases the capacity of DNA to enter the cell,(91-93) and therefore likely also the nucleus. Accordingly, integration studies would appear to be called for.</p>

<a href="#q70"><strong>Question 70:</strong></a> Question 70: What in vitro or in vivo models does FDA consider suitable to assess genomic integration of residual DNA, after appropriate validation?
</div>
<p>Noted are a series of elegant attempts conducted in FDA’s own laboratories led by Dr. Keith Peden to develop an animal model capable of assessing the oncogenic activity of DNA. (Sheng-Fowler et al (96-98)) Variously, tumors could be induced in athymic, immune-defective or transgenic mice, animals, newborn hamsters and rats after administration of oncogene-laden plasmid, particularly plasmid dually expressing H-ras and c-myc oncogenes. Sheng-Fowler et al. could induce tumor formation in small populations (n = 13 - 110) of mice with doses, in the case of linear plasmid, as low as 800 pg (97) or 300 pg (98) They were able to detect DNA integration in cells derived from induced tumors as well as expression of oncogene protein products. However, extracted DNA was unable to induce oncogenesis. The authors concluded that “available in vivo models are not sensitive enough to detect the oncogenicity of cellular DNA.” (98)</p>
<p>The challenge of model development is readily appreciated, with even greater challenges instore to establish clinical relevance, even if successful in the lab. Nonetheless, further model refinements may bear fruit, perhaps if not as a model for oncogenicity, but as one for integration. One paper (96) reported that transfection facilitators were unable the efficiency of tumor induction, although these studies appear highly limited.</p>

<h1 id="risk-of-episomal-extrachromosomal-expression"><span class="underline"><strong>Risk of episomal </strong></span><span class="underline"><strong>/ extrachromosomal expression</strong></span></h1>
<p>Insertional mutagenesis is not a prerequisite for expression of DNA introduced into cells. Indeed, this principle has been used to develop gene therapies by using episomal / extrachromosomal DNA eukaryotic vectors, as plasmids. (99) DNA produced by LINE-1 mediated reverse transcription from RNA, or RNA within sperm can be transferred to oocytes at fertilization and propagated during embryo formation. These sequences are extrachromosomal and can be transcribed to induce novel phenotypic traits. (100)</p>
<p>The risk of extrachromosomal expression of DNA is acknowledged by Moderna in its US Patent Application US 2013 / 0259924 A1:</p>
<p>“Alternatively, the heterologous deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) introduced into a cell can be inherited by daughter cells (whether or not the heterologous DNA has integrated into the chromosome) or by offspring.”</p>
<p>The SV40 promoter apparently of the same sequence as was found in the Pfizer pro-vaccine has been shown in cell culture to enhance expression of episomal DNA transgenes, without needing insertional mutagenesis&quot; (101)</p>

<h1 id="non-integrating-mechanisms-of-dna-toxicology"><span class="underline"><strong>Non-integrating mechanism</strong></span><span class="underline"><strong>s of DNA toxicology</strong></span></h1>
<p>Residual DNA may have toxic effects unrelated to genomic insertion.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Immunomodulatory activity</span></p>
<p>A paper by FDA staff Sheng-Fowler et al, (65) noted “Another biological activity of DNA that does not require gene expression is the immunomodulatory activity of DNA itself [9,10]. While this immunomodulatory activity can be measured in vivo, the amounts of DNA required for this effect are not typically present in vaccines.” </p>
<p>dsDNA in plasmid DNA vaccines may mediate adjuvanticity contributing to immunogenicity via a TANK-binding kinase 1 pathway (102) or via toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). A recently approved hepatitis B vaccine (Heplisav B) uses bacterial CpG motifs as an adjuvant. (103)</p>
<p><span class="underline">Effect on pattern receptors and innate immunity</span></p>
<p>DNA can stimulate the innate immune response ((104), cited in (48)) This property is one reason why its removal is said to be important in the production of mRNA. (Moderna patent US 10,077,439 B2) The effect of dsDNA as an activator of innate immunity via intracellular pattern recognition receptors has been described regarding prothrombotic effects vascular endothelium .(105) This is particularly concerning given the recent disclosure by VSD lead Dr. Nicola Klein at the September 12 2023 ACIP meeting of signals for acute myocardial infarction and venous thromboembolism.(106) as well as signals published by FDA staff for pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. (see also Error! Reference source not found.) An extensive review has been published of DNA’s action as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) able to drive inflammation via a number of pattern recognition receptors (PRR) including cGAS, AIM2, NOD, LRR, NLRP3, RAGE, TLR9. (107)</p>
<p>An association has been reported between ischemic stroke and the cGAS-STING pattern-receptor inflammatory pathway that can be triggered by pathogen, bacterial or viral dsDNA.(108) Two recent preprints whose authors included FDA scientists (109) or VSD lead Dr. Nicola Klein (110) found possible associations between non-hemorrhagic stroke and COVID-19 vaccination (see also Error! Reference source not found.).</p>
<p><span class="underline">Autoimmune reactions</span></p>
<p>WHO 2007 guidelines (49) in discussing the risks of injecting plasmid DNA includes the risk that: “Antibodies may be formed against the injected DNA itself and these may contribute towards undesired autoimmune reactions.” (p17/25) Further, it states that sensitive ELISA analysis form human and animal models “have shown that repeated DNA vaccination can stimulate a ≤ 5-fold increase in anti-DNA auto-antibody levels.”</p>
<p>The corresponding FDA document (64) [p8/13] expands the scope of this concern to an immune response against cells expressing the target antigen, but downplays the possibility of both based on preclinical data available at the time. Further, this FDA 2007 guidance “no longer recommend that preclinical studies be performed to specifically assess whether vaccination causes autoimmune disease,” instead “recommend that the general welfare of animals in preclinical immunogenicity and toxicity studies continue to be carefully monitored.” The guidance nonetheless noted that “Yet the possibility persists that DNA vaccines might idiosyncratically cause or worsen organ-specific autoimmunity by encoding antigens (including cryptic antigens) that cross-react with self.”</p>

<h1 id="experimental-findings-regarding-residual-dna"><span class="underline"><strong>Experimental findings regarding residual DNA</strong></span></h1>
<p>Dr. Ladapo’s concerns were focused on the then recently preprinted findings related to residual DNA in Pfizer and Moderna modRNA vaccines. (2,3) As Dr. Marks noted the existence of plasmid-derived residual DNA in not surprising as it is a known process related impurity. The main findings from this work were:</p>
<p>The amounts of residual DNA per dose approached or exceeded the 10 ng/dose guidance limit, depending on the assay method used.</p>
<p>Fragments larger than the 200 base pair length size described in guidelines (see ‎6.4) were found.</p>
<p>In the case of the Pfizer product, three sequences apparently not disclosed to regulators, were found. These were 1) SV40 enhancer/promoter/ori; 2) SV40 poly(A) signal; 3) HSV-TK poly(A) signal.</p>
<p>Intact sequences for the SV40 enhancer/promoter/ori and antibiotic resistance genes were found.</p>
<p>The authors acknowledged the obvious limitations to their work, and “urge that [their] work is replicated under forensic conditions.”(3) This work in various aspects has been confirmed by several laboratories (6-10) and, notably, by high school intern students working under FDA supervision.(11) Our own unpublished work has confirmed this with the Pfizer 2024-2025 JN.1 formula. Further, in numerous FOIA disclosures around the world, regulators have confirmed the presence of the SV40 sequence (including the Marks response (4) ) and the fact that Pfizer had chosen not to specifically disclose this regulatory sequence. One acknowledged limitation relates to interference by RNA in the measurement of DNA by Qubit fluorometry. Kammerer et al. (8) successfully reduced the fluorescence using RNAse, leaving a DNA signal corresponding to levels about the 10ng/ dose guideline (see below). There still remains the possibility that RNAse may not remove RNA that is hybridized to DNA. A number of factors are important in preparing samples for UV or fluorescence methods. Further, the absorption characteristics of N1 methylpseudouridinylated modRNA differ from those of uridine.(111) </p>
<p>These and other technical challenges in measurement of residual DNA are evident in industry forums, or efforts of the United States Pharmacopoeia (112,113) who are only now beginning to develop to develop compendial standards and test methods. The absence of an agreed upon test method for residual DNA is perhaps reflected in EMA’s recently (March 2025) guidelines on the quality aspects of mRNA vaccines, which stated “Orthogonal test methods should be used to quantify and characterise residual DNA.”(114)</p>
<h1 id="what-are-the-guidelines-concerning-residual-dna"><span class="underline"><strong>What are the guidelines concerning residual DNA?</strong></span></h1>
<p>Dr. Marks stated: “There are internationally agreed upon recommendations for the quantity of residual DNA present in all biological products, including the mRNA vaccines,” citing two documents:</p>

<h1 id="guidelines-on-amount-of-residual-dna"><span class="underline"><strong>Guidelines on amount of residual DNA</strong></span></h1>
<p>Both the FDA 2010 (63) (p40/50) and WHO 2007 (115) (p20/30) documents describe a limit for residual DNA at 10 ng/dose for parenteral administration.</p>
<p>Dr. Marks stated: “The specification for the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines for residual DNA following DNAse treatment results in the presence of DNA fragments at a quantity that is less than three orders of magnitude lower than the quantity of the RNA dose by weight. This has been determined (and continues to be determined during production of lots) with a validated quantitative PCR assay.”</p>
<p>The guidelines do not speak of residual DNA limits in terms of their proportion to the amount of RNA, indeed it is unclear why this ratio would be helpful, as surely any risk associated with of DNA would be independent of the amount of RNA.</p>
<p>The EMA do appear to regard this ratio as useful for specification purposes, confirming (116) that the “limit for residual DNA in Comirnaty active substance is 330ng DNA/mg RNA. This equates to &lt;10 ng DNA per adult dose (30 micrograms RNA) of Comirnaty.” This computes to a ratio of 3030:1 of RNA to DNA by weight, consistent with Dr. Marks’ statement that the “presence of DNA fragments […] is less than three orders of magnitude lower than the quantity of the RNA dose by weight.”</p>
<p>As discussed below (‎6.3), the representation of this sort of ratio is highly misleading due to differences in methods use to assay the DNA and RNA.</p>
<div class="question" id="q82">
<a href="#q82"><strong>Question 82:</strong></a> Question 82: Why does FDA consider the ratio of residual DNA to the amount of RNA relevant in determining the absolute risk of residual DNA in modRNA vaccines? Is this ratio used in the setting of specifications for Drug Substance or Drug Product? What is this specification?
</div>
<h1 id="guidelines-on-additional-considerations-for-amount"><span class="underline"><strong>Guidelines on additional considerations for amount of residual DNA</strong></span></h1>
<p>Dr. Marks stated: “The agency has taken into account the totality of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine product, including the lipid nanoparticles, as it reviewed the manufacturers’ specifications for residual DNA fragments present.”</p>
<p>This statement is inconsistent with the documents cited. On the one hand, as described above, the documents cite a residual DNA limit of 10 ng/dose. On the other hand, one of the cited documents (FDA 2010 (63)), as well as others provide for adjustments according to particular circumstances. The 2013 WHO recommendations (50)(p10/110) regarding animal cell cultures as substrates, describe “recommendations for acceptable levels of residual cellular DNA are product specific.” (emphasis added)</p>
<p>At the heart of the matter is the fact that LNP packaging increases nucleic acid transfection tens to hundreds of times more extensively than for naked nucleic acid.(91-93)</p>
<p>However, the downgrading (see ‎4.1) of the integration risk reflected in the WHO 2021 document  (48) is restricted by the experience of DNA vaccines with limited distribution and persistence, noting (p13/54) that there “is a wealth of evidence that DNA vaccines to date do not persist or even biodistribute throughout the body of the vaccine recipient when delivered parenterally into muscle,”</p>
<p>Accordingly, these comments cannot be used to dismiss my concerns related to a highly efficient and widespread LNP transfection, nor the principles embodied in the earlier 2007 version (49) of the (48) document: “There would be a need to reassess integration if there was a significant change in the method of delivery, especially any change potentially involving an increase in the capacity of plasmid DNA to enter the nucleus.” (p18/25) (see also ‎4.4)</p>
<p>This would certainly be true of a LNP, especially one that contains an SV40 nuclear localization sequence (see ‎4.2). This WHO 2007 document, (49) in the context of discussing non-clinical programs (p20/25), gives an example of electroporation as a “technique used to improve the uptake of the plasmid.” Electroporation is discussed by Wang et al. (117) and cited by the guideline in another context, also by FDA’s 2007 guidance (64).  Wang et al., showed  that electroporation could increase plasmid tissue levels in mice by six- to 34-times and the level of plasmid associated with genomic DNA. In this example, DNA limits might be reduced by a factor of between six and 34.</p>

<p>Dr. Marks’ cited FDA 2010 (63) document provides an example calculation whereby the recommended DNA limit is raised, based on uptake that is less efficient for orally, rather than parenterally administered DNA:</p>
<p>“You should limit residual DNA for continuous non-tumorigenic cells, such as low-passage Vero cells, to less than 10 ng/dose for parenteral inoculation as recommended by WHO [original Ref. 31]. Because orally administered DNA is taken up approximately 10,000-fold less efficiently than parenterally administered DNA, we recommend limiting DNA to less than 100 μg/dose for oral vaccines [original Ref. 32]” (p40/50)</p>
<p>In this case with an assumed fold-decrease in efficiency of 10,000, the DNA limit of 10 ng/dose for a parenteral dose is raised to 10,000 x 10 ng = 100 μg/dose.</p>

</div>
<p>Both the FDA 2007 (64) (p10/13) and WHO 2007 (49) (p23/25) documents addressing DNA plasmid vaccines but involving principles applicable to residual DNA, discuss integration risk in terms of number of DNA copies per μg of tissue, their distribution and persistence.

<p><span class="underline">The c</span><span class="underline">ited WHO and FDA documents do not spec</span><span class="underline">ify</span><span class="underline"> a test method for residual DNA</span></p>
<p>Although the FDA 2010 (63) document mentions PCR as a test method in other contexts, it does not specify a method to quantify residual DNA.</p>
<p>The cited WHO 2007 (115) document states: “With respect to the specification for residual cellular (rc) DNA in the final products, it has been considered that a 10 ng/dose was appropriate for biologicals produced in continuous cell lines. This specification is not associated with an analytical method, and thus additional points should be taken into consideration.” (p20/30) (emphasis added)</p>
<p>This document states that the DNA limit should be defined based on, inter alia, the assay method: (emphasis added) “A risk assessment should be done in order to define the DNA upper limit for a particular vaccine or biological product, based on the following parameters: nature of the cell substrate, inactivation process, the method used to assess DNA content, and the size distribution of DNA fragments.” (p20/30) The document does recognize the value of qPCR as a “highly sensitive and reproducible technique,” (p21/30) but in connection with fragment size analysis, results should be adjusted for amplicon length and amplification efficiency.</p>

<p>Referring to the use of qPCR to determine the excess of RNA over DNA by three orders of magnitude is misleading because it also implies that RNA is similarly measured.

<p>It is well known that a qPCR method underestimates the amount of residual DNA. Moderna’s 2018 US Patent 10,077,439 B2 titled “Removal of DNA fragments in mRNA production process” explains:</p>
<p>“Quantitative PCR is often applied to measure the residual DNA but it only detects the DNA molecules that contain both qPCR primers thus does not measure all other smaller DNA molecules that are partially digested.”</p>
<p>Just as UV and fluorescence methods detect small and large fragments of RNA, they can be used similarly for DNA, especially for fragments substantially smaller than the amplicon length used in PCR. The amount of DNA estimated by these methods can exceed the amount estimated by qPCR by multiples of tens or hundreds. The use of UV absorbance at 250 nm to method to estimate plasmid quantity is referred to in a 2021 WHO guideline.(48)</p>

<p>Both documents cited by Dr. Marks regarding “internationally agreed upon recommendations for the quantity of residual DNA” describe the need to characterize the size distribution of residual DNA fragments, and to limit the fragment size to below 200 base pairs (emphasis added):</p>
<p><span class="underline">FDA 2010 </span><span class="underline">(63)</span></p>
<p>“You should measure the amount and size distribution of residual DNA in your final product.” (p40/50)</p>
<p>“The risks of oncogenicity and infectivity of your cell-substrate DNA can be lessened by decreasing its biological activity. This can be accomplished by decreasing the amount of residual DNA and reducing the size of the DNA (e.g., by DNAse treatment or other methods) to below the size of a functional gene (based on current evidence, approximately 200 base pairs).” (p40/50)</p>
<p><span class="underline">WHO 2007 </span><span class="underline">(115)</span></p>
<p>“Studies performed at CBER suggest that DNA fragments smaller than 200 bp will give substantial safety margins for products that meet the 10 ng per dose limit. This raised some questions concerning the feasibility of detecting small DNA fragments and of quantifying the proportion of the digested DNA of different sizes.” (p18/30)</p>
<p>“Discussion on the determination of small DNA fragments led to the conclusion that quantitative amplification methods can detect DNA fragments with sufficient sensitivity. In addition, it was concluded that in order to determine the percentage of fragments within a certain size range, both fragments smaller than 200 bp and those larger than this value should be measured and compared, adjusting results for length of the amplicon (and thus amplification efficiency). It was recognized that qPCR is a highly sensitive and reproducible technique.” (p21/30)</p>
<p>“A risk assessment should be done in order to define the DNA upper limit for a particular vaccine or biological product, based on the following parameters: nature of the cell substrate, inactivation process, the method used to assess DNA content, and the size distribution of DNA fragments.” (p20/30)</p>

<p>Dr. Marks’ cited WHO 2007 (115) document refers to work at FDA’s CBER that “DNA fragments smaller than 200 bp will give substantial safety margins for products that meet the 10 ng per dose limit.” (p18/30) This implies that the same safety margin at the same 10 ng dose limit will not exist in lots containing fragments larger than 200 bp.</p>

<p>The premise underlying the 200 bp size limit described in the FDA 2010 (63) document, is that lengths below this are considered to be “below the size of a functional gene.” (p40/50)</p>

<h1 id="concerns-regarding-residual-dna-fragments-smaller-"><strong> </strong><span class="underline"><strong>Concerns regarding </strong></span><span class="underline"><strong>residual DNA </strong></span><span class="underline"><strong>fragments smaller than the 200 bp guideline</strong></span></h1>
<p>The 200 bp guideline in FDA 2010 (63) is linked to a concern that a functional DNA sequence may integrate into the genome: (excerpted):”The risks […] can be lessened by […] reducing the size of the DNA […] to below the size of a functional gene (based on current evidence, approximately 200 base pairs).” (p40/50)</p>
<p>Indeed, the 10 ng/ dose limit appears to be linked to the 200 bp size limit in the WHO 2007 (115) reference to work at FDA’s CBER that “DNA fragments smaller than 200 bp will give substantial safety margins for products that meet the 10 ng per dose limit.” (p18/30)</p>
<p>This linkage of fragment size to dose to risk related to insertion of a functional gene might explain the apparent non-concern that qPCR, as discussed above will fail to detect small fragments (see Question 94), perhaps those smaller than approximately 100-200bp. Importantly this linkage ignores other risks of DNA that are independent of fragment size (see ‎4.6) and insertional mutagenesis.(49) FDA’s Sheng-Fowler et al., (65) posit two mechanisms for DNA-induced oncogenesis through integration:</p>
<p>Activation or increased expression of a proto-oncogene such as c-myc, should integration occur next to the proto-oncogene.</p>
<p>Functional Inactivation of a tumor-suppressor gene, such as the p53 gene (119)  or the RB gene, should DNA integration occur within that gene.</p>
<p>Similarly, depending on the site of insertion, integration could interfere with the function of other genes, and in a manner independent of fragment size.</p>
<p>In their 2010 review of FDA guidance on DNA vaccines, authors mostly from the National Cancer Institute (120) noted “the technology used to detect plasmid persistence does not examine the frequency with which short fragments of plasmid integrate. In this context, sections of DNA as short as 7 bp can affect rates of integration or recombination.”</p>
<p>In his testimony to a committee of the South Carolina Senate, Dr. Phillip Buckhaults (10) stated that “the probability of a DNA piece of DNA integrating into the human genome is unrelated to its size.” </p>
<div class="image-container">
<img src="WisemanGutschi2025FDAIntrospection091325_images/image19.png" alt="Document image image19.png" />
</div>
<p>Figure 7: DNA fragment size analysis reported by Dr. Phillip Buckhaults (10). Red line added indicating the approximate position of a peak at about 100 bp</p>
<p>Dr. Buckhaults further testified that “your genome risk is just a function of how many particles there are,” and noted that the “pieces are very small because during the process they chopped them up to try to make them go away but they actually increased the hazard of genome modification in the process.”</p>
<p>As can be seen from Figure 6 and Figure 7 a substantial fraction of residual DNA is smaller than the 200 bp size limit, representing a substantial potential risk that has not been considered.</p>
<p>The apparent discounting of the possible risks of small fragment residual DNA serves only to heighten concerns expressed in earlier questions, particularly Question 71 and Question 69.</p>
<p>The relief of earlier concerns about plasmid DNA expressed in the WHO 2021 guideline (48) may have been based, partly on the notion that the “local response to plasmid DNA inoculation is that cells take up the plasmid and then express the immunogen(s) encoded in the DNA vaccine and/or the nucleic acid is degraded by normal molecular mechanisms.” (p14/54) This degradation may have been considered to be more rapid for naked DNA shorter than 200 bp. These mitigating factors cannot be assumed to apply to residual DNA that could be encapsulated and protected by LNPs,(see p21/66 in (71)) or that may form RNA hybrids that are resistant to endonucleases, or the possibility of DNA-lipid adducts (Section ‎8).</p>
<p>The 2007 FDA guidance on plasmid vaccines articulates a principle that is applicable to modRNA vaccines: </p>
<p>“If the DNA sequence of the insert gene and/or backbone vector of a DNA vaccine are changed, we recommend that you consult with CBER to discuss whether the nature and/or magnitude of the change(s) warrant the conduct of additional preclinical studies and/or the submission of a new IND. You should provide to CBER a description of the changes in manufacturing process and the results from preclinical safety evaluations of the new (modified) DNA vaccine.” [p5/13]</p>

<p>There are several concerns related to these sequences, particularly as they have been found as intact sequences.</p>
<h1 id="antibiotic-resistance-gene"><span class="underline"><strong>Antibiotic resistance gene</strong></span></h1>
<p>Valera et al. noted that antibiotic resistance genes used in the infection or transfection protocols may, if introduced into mammalian cells exert a biological effect:  “neo gene expression may induce changes in the cells, which should be considered when neo-selected cells are used to deliver specific genes in different therapy approaches and in embryo manipulation.”(121)</p>
<p>The WHO 2007 guideline (49) on plasmid DNA vaccines states: </p>
<p>“If other gene constructs are included in the plasmid, such as antibiotic resistance genes for manufacturing reasons, then the possibility of expression of such gene sequences in mammalian cells or in microorganisms which are potentially pathogenic, and the possible clinical consequences of such expression, should be considered.” (p20/25).</p>

<p>Dr. Marks stated: <em>“No SV40 proteins are encoded for or are present in the vaccines.” </em>The authors of the studies (2,3) describing SV40 sequences in the modRNA vaccines do not assert that SV40 proteins are present in the vaccine. None of my questions concern the expression of SV40 proteins, as the sequence concerned is a regulatory element that is not acting via protein expression.</p>
<p>There are debated associations between SV40<em> </em><span class="underline"><em>virus</em></span> and cancer (122) particularly regarding contaminated polio vaccines in the 1960s and the role of the SV40 Large T antigen oncoprotein.(123) Another chapter (Tumor viruses) in the textbook (57) cited by Dr. Marks (see ‎4.2) discusses genomic integration with DNA viruses such as the SV40 virus. FDA’s own staff acknowledge that SV40 virus contains “potent viral oncogenes” (97)</p>
<h1 id="possible-consequences-of-the-sv40-enhancer-promoto"><span class="underline"><strong>Possible consequences of the SV40 enhancer-promotor-ori sequences</strong></span></h1>
<p>The above cited 2010 review of FDA guidance on DNA vaccines from the National Cancer Institute (120) observed that <em>“in evaluating the potential harm of plasmid integration, it should be noted that the risk of introducing plasmids with </em><em><strong>strong regulatory regions</strong></em><em> into the host genome far exceeds that associated with random point mutations.”</em><em> </em>(emphasis added)<em> </em>The SV40 enhancer=promoter-ori sequence would certainly qualify as a<em> “strong regulatory region.”</em></p>
<p>The nuclear localization properties of this sequence have been discussed above (see ‎4.2). Additionally this sequence binds the p53 protein (119) which has both tumor suppressor (119) and antiviral (124) properties. Sequestering p53 may therefore have consequences in terms of oncogenesis and viral pathogenicity. <em>The SV40 promoter </em><em><strong>may also </strong></em><em>enhance expression of episomal DNA transgenes, without need</em><em><strong>ing</strong></em><em> insertional mutagenesis&quot; </em>(101) (see ‎4.5). See Question 127 and Question 128.</p>
<h1 id="was-the-sv40-and-other-sequence-and-other-sequence"><span class="underline"><strong>Was</strong></span><span class="underline"><strong> th</strong></span><span class="underline"><strong>e SV40 and other </strong></span><span class="underline"><strong>sequence </strong></span><span class="underline"><strong>and other sequences identified </strong></span><span class="underline"><strong>to FDA?</strong></span></h1>
<p>The FDA 2010 guidance (63) cited by Dr. Marks addresses the necessity of providing information about plasmids used in vaccine production: <em>“Whatever starting materials are used for the generation of the cell substrate (e.g., parent cells or </em><em><strong>plasmids</strong></em><em> used for genetically engineered cells), </em><em><strong>any available information</strong></em><em> about those starting materials and their characterization (e.g., </em><em><strong>sequence of the plasmid</strong></em><em>) </em><em><strong>should be provided</strong></em><em>.” </em>(p9/50) (emphasis added)</p>
<p>A 2021 WHO document (71) on mRNA vaccines provides more detail on this guideline, at least for the DNA template: <em>“The annotated sequence of the </em><em><strong>DNA template</strong></em><em> should be provided. The sequence and position or length of all elements contained within the mRNA, including start and stop codons, flanking UTRs, regulatory elements (for example, promoter for the RNA polymerase) and 5′ cap and 3′ poly(A) tail, should be provided, as well as the ORF for the target antigen. If any additional proteins are encoded (such as those for a self-amplifying construct or a cytokine) their sequence should be provided (see points d and e below). The presence and function of any additional sequences included in the construct should be described.”</em> (p24/66)</p>
<p>However, in the absence of further details in the 2010 FDA document, (63) the FDA 2007 guidance regarding plasmid DNA vaccines.(64) furnishes broadly applicable principles regarding the disclosure of the nature of the plasmid (p4/13) that manufacturers “<em>should provide detailed descriptions of the plasmid construction, including the source and diagrams of all plasmids used </em>[…] <em>along with an annotated sequence identifying all open reading frames including any unexpected open reading frames </em><em><strong>and/or other sequence elements</strong></em><em>.”</em> (emphasis added) WHO guidelines from 2007 (49) (p8/25) and 2021 (48) (p18/54) contain similar language.</p>
<p>In a response to the Epoch Times, Health Canada stated: <em>“Health Canada expects sponsors to identify any biologically functional DNA sequences within a plasmid (such as an SV40 enhancer) at the time of submission. Although the full DNA sequence of the Pfizer plasmid was provided at the time of initial filing, the sponsor did not specifically identify SV40 sequence</em>.”</p>
<p>The need to provide the details of plasmid construction as part of the manufacturing and quality review is self-evident. The plasmid map appeared in an EMA assessment report,(125) shown below and compares Pfizer’s disclosed plasmid map with that generated by Illumina sequencing by McKernan et al. (2,3) In this graphic, the orientation of the EMA-disclosure sequence has been flipped to facilitate comparison between the two maps.</p>
<div class="image-container">

</div>
<p>Figure 8: Comparison of plasmid maps obtained by McKernan et al., and as disclosed to EMA</p>
<p>The red boxes show that three sequences were not disclosed to the EMA: 1) SV40-promoter-enhancer-ori, 2) SV40 poly(A) signal; 3) HSV-TK poly(A) signal. These are all regulatory sequences. There are two other features of note:</p>
<ul>
<li>The AmpR promoter which is a regulatory sequence required for the expression of the antibiotic resistance gene needed for production of the plasmid, is missing in the Pfizer version.</li>
<li>Software, such as Snapgene, generates these plasmid maps within seconds of loading the sequence, showing all the sequence elements, as was the case in the McKernan version. It appears that using this software for the three undisclosed sequences to be absent from the Pfizer version would have likely have required editing of the generated map by the selection of a particular element and using the “delete” function to delete it.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a November 27 2023 response to a posed question (116), EMA confirmed that: <em>“an SV40 sequence is present in the DNA plasmid starting material of Comirnaty and its adapted vaccines, including Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5.”</em></p>
<p>EMA further noted: <em>“The full DNA sequence of the plasmid starting material was provided in the initial marketing </em><em>authorisation</em><em> application for Comirnaty. The MAH </em>[Marketing Authorization Holder]<em> did not specifically highlight the SV40 sequence, as it was considered to be a non-functional part of the plasmid. They have since clarified this information in response to questions raised by EMA.”</em></p>
<p>It appears from this response that Pfizer’s non-disclosure of these sequences was a purposeful rather than an inadvertent act, having at some point conducted what amounts to a risk assessment regarding this sequence that had not been disclosed to EMA because it “<em>considered </em>[the SV40 enhancer-promoter sequence]<em> to be a non-functional part of the plasmid</em>.” (116) Even if it could be argued that FDA guidances for plasmid-based DNA vaccine cannot be applied to modRNA vaccines made from plasmid templates, submission of a plasmid map from which certain sequences have been removed without remark appears to constitute a false or misleading disclosure.</p>
<p>A FOIA disclosure from Health Canada (118) confirmed this:</p>
<p><em>“Pfizer has communicated to us recently, that they apparently chose not to mention this information to EMA, </em><em>FDA</em><em> or HC at the time of t </em><em>heir</em><em> initial or subsequent submissions. However, as of April of this year this information was independently made public, which has resulted to questions coming to agencies.”</em> (p162/584)</p>

<p>What makes the absence of any risk assessment regarding these sequences all the more egregious is the fact that this must have been omitted from a risk assessment submitted to EMA relating to process-related impurities, as memorialized in the EMA Assessment of February 19 2021 (30) (p19/140): “A safety risk assessment for potential process-related impurities included in the active substance process relative to patient safety was performed.

<p>In 2021 Moderna scientists (128) described the formation of lipid-mRNA adducts in LNPs. In their 2022 Science Day presentation,(129) Moderna revealed that these adducts result from aldehyde formation related to impurities in LNP raw materials. The formation of adducts may stall ribosomal translation, inactivating the entire mRNA molecule. Adducts could be avoided by control of the manufacturing process and by using “aldehyde sinks” such as Tris as buffers instead of the more common PBS (phosphate buffered-saline).</p>
<p>Figure 9: Slides from Moderna’s 2022 Science Day presentations (130)</p>
<p>This information appears absent from Moderna’s Science Day presentation in 2020. (130) Given that dosing in Moderna’s distribution study was initiated on July 10 2017 (p11/280) and the report approved on December 13 2017 (p25/280) (131) it seems unlikely that this study predated Moderna’s discoveries regarding lipid-mRNA adducts. </p>
<p>During storage, tertiary amine–based LNP lipids can oxidize to form reactive aldehydes that covalently adduct modRNA, blocking its translation after injection.(128) These findings raise concerns that lipid–RNA adducts may contribute to LNP persistence, unmeasured toxicity, and poorly understood long-term biodistribution and toxicity. (132)</p>
<p>Adducted modRNA taken up by cells may be sensed as abnormal or viral-like, triggering interferon signaling and contributing to systemic immune dysregulation.(Cordes, J.; Zhao, S.; Engel, C. M.; Stingele, J. Cellular responses to RNA damage. Cell 2025, 188 (4), 885-900. DOI: )</p>
<p>In addition to their effects on translation, a variety of disorders and diseases may be related to aldehydes. Various DNA adducts may be mutagenic: “Mutagenesis could result from the processing of either DNA adducts or a combination of DNA, RNA, and protein adducts.”(133) Some possible mechanisms have been discussed elsewhere. (134) DNA adducts mentioned in FDA’s 1997 guidance on genotoxicity testing of drugs. (p6/12 in (135))</p>
<p>In a EMA recommendation (p163/169 in (136)) Moderna was asked to <em>“provide evidence to confirm that the impurities and/or degradation products resulting from PEG2000-DMG, cholesterol and DSPC have been sufficiently investigated and do not result in the formation of lipid-RNA species by 31-01-2021.”</em></p>

<h1 id="process-3-pfizer-buffer-change"><span class="underline"><strong>Process 3: Pfizer buffer change</strong></span></h1>
<p>In October 2021, Pfizer changed the buffer in their pro-vaccine product from PBS to Tris, ostensibly to make the cold storage requirements less onerous. FDA authorized this switch based on bench top analytical rather than animal or human trial comparability. Although Moderna had described (see above) the role of buffer on lipid adduct formation, this was not widely known or described to VRBPAC.</p>
<p>More recently (December 2023), a BioNTech patent application (137) describing the advantages of using Tris buffer compared with PBS. The main advantage, different from those given by Moderna but with the same end result, is that the Tris prevents the mRNA strand from folding in a certain way that would otherwise impair its translation. The patent application also describes other modifications to the composition of the LNP buffer solution that along with the Tris, alter the stability of LNPs. </p>
<p>It is difficult to understand why, given the formation of the folded mRNA structures, this sort of process (“Process 3”) change would be suspected of affecting safety and effectiveness and therefore trigger biological comparability studies. (138) Moderna have discussed how buffer may affect a number of LNP, properties, such as size, pharmacokinetics, and expression kinetics.(139)  Others have described the effects of different buffers in  in vitro and in vivo models on the mRNA transfection efficiency of LNP.(140)</p>
<p>Even more concerning is that BioNTech’s patent application was filed on November 15, 2021, just two weeks after FDA authorized (141) the formulation change on October 29 2021 based on the premise that the new buffer would improve stability and storage cold requirements with no mention that the molecular form of the mRNA would be changed. Yet more concerning is that BioNtech may have known about these problematic molecular forms and the stability of LNPs in different buffer solutions a year earlier, around the time of the original EUA. Table 2 of the patent application (137) provides the dates of some of these experiments – from December 18 2020 to January 22 2021.</p>

<h1 id="novel-heterotrimers-in-bivalent-pro-vaccines-proce"><span class="underline"><strong>Novel heterotrimers in bivalent pro-vaccines: Process 2 for Moderna, Process 4 for Pfizer</strong></span></h1>
<p>As we have discussed previously, (142,143) on August 31<sup>st</sup> 2022 FDA issued EUAs for “bivalent” Covid-19 versions of the Pfizer (144)  and Moderna (145) modRNA pro-vaccines. Since the spike proteins of the BA.4 and BA.5 variants are identical,(146) these vaccines are said to be “bivalent” because they contain modRNA encoding for the spike proteins of the Wuhan and BA4/5 variants. </p>
<p>The term bivalent is a misnomer. Moderna revealed at the Sept 1st ACIP meeting (142,147) that their bivalent vaccine elicits the formation of novel spike protein heterotrimers to produce a superior immunological response. This occurs because the modRNA for each variant is loaded into the same LNPs. Transfected cells then produce spike protein monomers of each type, which then aggregate into trimers. Four trimers are possible: homotrimers for each of the Wuhan or BA4/5 variants, plus heterotrimers containing either two Wuhan monomers plus one BA4/5 monomer, or one Wuhan monomer plus two BA4/5 monomers.</p>
<p>Thus, the two heterotrimers are entirely novel. Since they have novel chemistry and pharmacology (according to Moderna), they may also have a novel yet untested toxicology. Based on EMA documents, it is likely that the same occurs for the Pfizer bivalent vaccine. </p>
<p>Indeed, Wagenhauser et al. reported (148) that the <em>“rate of adverse reactions for the second booster dose was significantly higher among participants receiving the bivalent 84.6% (95% CI 70.3%-92.8%; 33/39) compared to the monovalent 51.4% (95% CI 35.9-66.6%; 19/37) vaccine (p=0.0028).”</em></p>

</div>
<p>Figure 11: Graphical results from Wagenhauser et al. (148)</p>
<p>In March 2022, contemplating that updated versions of the original COVID-19 pro-vaccines would be needed, FDA modified its guidelines for the issuance of EUA.(149) The update stated: “FDA expects that much of the manufacturing process and controls, as well as the facilities for vaccine production, for the modified COVID-19 vaccine will be identical to that of the prototype COVID-19 vaccine.”</p>
<p>Producing these bivalent products requires significant changes in manufacturing that go well beyond their expectations of manufacturing comparability with the original versions. Thus, for Pfizer, the production of their bivalent product should constitute “Process 4,” and for Moderna, “Process 2.”</p>
<p>As we reported, (150) at a meeting between the React19 vaccine injury group and FDA on December 14, 2022, FDA acknowledged that heterotrimer formation is possible with the bivalent vaccines, but claimed that just because heterotrimers may display different antigen properties from homotrimers, their toxicological properties would likely be the same. Despite undertaking to provide further information, this was not forthcoming.</p>

<p>Responding to concerns about genomic integration of residual DNA into the genome, mutagenesis, and cancer risk. Dr. Marks included two statements regarding the results of genotoxicity studies conducted in animals.</p>
<p>The first statement:<em> </em><em>“Additionally, animal studies with the mRNA delivery technology done over the past decade show no evidence of genotoxicity.”</em></p>
<p>This statement provides no details of what studies were conducted or assurance that any of the prototypes tested “over the past decade” were comparable in their formulation, composition of LNPs, plasmid sequence (if used), type of template used, method of manufacture, type of nucleoside modification, codon optimization, sequence of non-coding regions and levels of impurities.</p>
<div class="question" id="q155">
<a href="#q155"><strong>Question 155:</strong></a> Question 155: Which peer reviewed paper(s) or regulatory document(s), including submissions from Pfizer or Moderna describe the details of “animal studies with the mRNA delivery technology done over the past decade” that “show no evidence of genotoxicity.” Please provide.
</div>
<p>The second statement:<em> </em><em>“Additionally, studies have been conducted in animals </em><em><strong>using the modified mRNA and lipid nanoparticle together that constitute the vaccine</strong></em><em>, including the minute quantities of residual DNA fragments left over after </em><em>DNAse</em><em> treatment during manufacturing, and </em><em><strong>demonstrate no evidence for genotoxicity</strong></em><em> from the vaccine</em>.” (emphasis added) Footnote 3 to this statement contains two URLs, pointing to the “Summary Basis for Regulatory Action” documents for COMIRNATY (47) and SPIKEVAX. (151)</p>
<p>The assertion that these genotoxicity studies were conducted “using the modified mRNA and lipid nanoparticle together that constitute the vaccine” should be read with a related assertion in the FDA same document cited (151) concerning a biodistribution study performed on non-candidate modRNA vaccine of redacted identity. </p>
<p>FDA represents (p14/30) that because the test article was “manufactured using the same procedure as SPIKEVAX” it contained LNPs whose properties matched those of SPIKEVAX, including its “biodistribution and retention” properties. (Figure 12).</p>

<p>Both assertions “using the modified mRNA and lipid nanoparticle together that constitute the vaccine” and “manufactured using the same procedure” provide the foundation for the substitution of directly relevant studies by supportive studies.</p>
<p>A close examination of the formulations used in these studies reveals that these assertions are at best misleading, and in some cases false. It should go without saying that manufacturing procedure and formulation play critical roles in determining the behavior, distribution, and transfection of LNPs, affecting vaccine pharmacology and toxicology. Thus, over-extending extrapolations from supportive studies affects the interpretation and weighing of evidence that has supported the issuance of EUAs and BLAs.</p>

<p>The EMA assessment of the Moderna vaccine (136) reveals several formulation differences between the CMV vaccine (mRNA 1637) and Moderna’s candidate mRNA 1273 used in the biodistribution study and one of the toxicology studies (study T5 Table 1). Footnotes a and c to Table 1 describe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Footnote c: <em>“mRNA-1647 contains 6 mRNAs which encode the full-length CMV </em><em>gB</em><em> and the pentameric </em><em>gH</em><em>/</em><em>gL</em><em>/UL128/UL130/UL131A glycoprotein complex. The 6 mRNAs are formulated at a target mass ratio of </em><em>1:1:1:1:1:1</em><em> in a mixture of 4 lipids (SM-102, PEG2000-DMG, cholesterol, and DSPC) and formulated in 93 mM Tris, 60 mM NaCl, and 7% </em><em>PG.</em>“ </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Footnote a: <em>“mRNA-1273 contains a single mRNA sequence that encodes for the full-length SARS-CoV-2 S-2P combined in a mixture of 4 lipids (SM-102, PEG2000-DMG, cholesterol, and DSPC) and formulated in 20 mM Tris, 87 mg/mL sucrose, 10.7 mM sodium acetate, pH 7.5.“</em> This composition appears to be that of the development lots used in the nonclinical program described in Moderna’s nonclinical review (152)<sup><strong>Error! Bookmark not defined.</strong></sup> at a mRNA concentration of 0.5 mg/ml whose preparation was said to be comparable to the manufacturing process used to make in clinical trial material with a composition of mRNA 0.2 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris buffer containing 87 g/L sucrose and 4.3 mM acetate, at pH 7.5. </li>
</ul>
<p>The differences (Table 2) in Tris, sucrose, sodium acetate, NaCl and “PG” (see Question 210) content controvert FDA’s assertion that the test article in the biodistribution study was “manufactured using the same procedure as SPIKEVAX.” In the absence of any validating evidence to the contrary, these sorts of differences are likely to modulate various physicochemical properties of the LNPs (in addition to particle size) that could affect LNP distribution and transfection.</p>

<p>The EMA document (136) notes (p47/169) that the “The amount of the LNPs in the test material differed slightly in particle size from the final vaccine formulation of mRNA-1273.” </p>
<p>This disclosure, omitted in the FDA document, (151) challenges FDA’s representation (p14/30) that because the test article was “manufactured using the same procedure as SPIKEVAX” it contained LNPs whose properties matched those of SPIKEVAX, including its “biodistribution and retention” properties (Figure 12).</p>
<p>Moderna scientists published data showing that using a CMV vaccine in a model system, LNP particle size had a substantial difference on immunogenicity in mice but not in non-human primates.(153) The EMA document (p47/169 in (136)) points out that the unknown impact of this size difference on mRNA distribution, although offers some speculation regarding the liver:</p>
<p>“Even though it is not straightforward to understand the impact that the different particle size might have on mRNA tissue distribution, if any, nevertheless the liver distribution is not affected because the average diameter of endothelial fenestrae in the liver sinusoids in the rats The observed biodistribution with smaller LNP particle size should thus represent a worst-case scenario.” (p47/169) (emphasis added)</p>

<p>The study report of Moderna’s investigation, conducted by Charles River (131) provides evidence of further departure from the assumptions of formulation and manufacturing comparability between mRNA 1647 and mRNA 1273.</p>
<p>The mRNA-1647 test article was supplied at a concentration of 1.9 mg/ml (p11/280) which required dilution. This differs from the 0.2 or 0.5 mg/ml concentration, requiring no dilution, depicted in the EMA (136) and (154) documents.

<h1 id="inadequate-preclinical-use-of-animals-with-spike-a"><strong> </strong><strong>Inadequate preclinical use of animals with spike-ACE2R binding relevant characteristics</strong></h1>
<p>An additional concern relates to the choice of animal models for nonclinical studies. Efforts have been made to identify or develop animal models to study the pathophysiology of SARS-Cov-2 infection or to develop therapeutics. (155) A particular challenge has been to model the binding of the viral spike protein which mediates cell entry, particularly its interactions with the ACE2 receptor. Jiang et al. noted: (156)</p>
<p>“The predicted 29 amino acid residues of ACE2 that interact with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) vary between human ACE2 and mouse or rat ACE2. Therefore, wildtype mice and rats show lower SARS-CoV-2 infection rate and mild symptoms compared to what is seen in humans. Small animal models that recapitulate human COVID-19 disease are urgently needed for better understanding the transmission and therapeutic measurement. “</p>
<p>Brooke and Prischi (157) conducted structural and functional modeling studies in several species with the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein, and the three main proteins with which it acts: ACE2 receptor, TMPRSS2 and furin. While TMPRSS2 and furin are largely conserved between species, the sequence of ACE2 is more variable, influencing spike protein binding. Of the species studied, macaque, ferrets and hamster appeared most suitable to study the effects of anti-SARSCov-2 antibodies and small molecule inhibitors of the spike-ACE2 interaction. Rats, along with rabbits, Guinea pigs, mice, were determined not to constitute a suitable model. The authors suggested that transgenic animals expressing human ACE2 would likely provide useful for models of viral entry. Both mouse and rat models expressing human ACE2 have been developed. (156) Although the murine version is used more commonly, (e.g. (158,159)) a rat hACE2 model is also commercially available.</p>
<p>In selecting the macaque for immunogenicity and viral challenge studies, Pfizer (160) acknowledged the importance of an ACE2-relevant species:</p>
<p><em>“The human and rhesus ACE-2 receptor have 100% amino acid identity at the critical binding residues, which may account for the fidelity of this SARS-CoV-2 animal model.” </em>(p12/36)</p>
<p>The challenge of selecting an appropriate animal model was acknowledged by Moderna in the context of immunogenicity studies:</p>
<p><em>“Wild-type (WT) mice are a convenient and easy-to-use model to assess vaccine immunogenicity; however, the ACE-2 receptor, the primary route for SARS-CoV-2 binding and entry, differs significantly between mice and humans and, as result, WT SARS-CoV-2 does not infect mice.” </em>(p7/31) (152)</p>
<p>Moderna continues and explains that its approach in this case was to use a mouse-adapted SARS-Cov-2 strain: </p>
<p><em>“Therefore, a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain, which was developed by the laboratory of Dr. Ralph Baric at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, was used to assess protection of immunized mice from SARS-CoV-2 challenge.</em> “(p7/31) (152)</p>
<p>Moderna also discussed the related question of selecting suitable animal models to study vaccine-associated ERD.“ (p7/31) (152)</p>
<p>Clearly both Pfizer and Moderna understood the importance of ACE2-relevant models for various aspects of their nonclinical programs. However. since some toxic or genotoxic effects of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines may be related to the distribution of expressed spike protein, likely dependent in part on ACE2 binding, similar considerations of an ACE2-relevant model should also apply to toxicity and genotoxicity studies, as well as to studies of spike protein expression.</p>
<p>This was not the case, as the rat was chosen based, at least according to Moderna, (p8/31) (152) because of its acceptance as a species for nonclinical toxicology testing by regulatory agencies.</p>

<a href="#q162"><strong>Question 162:</strong></a> Question 162: What consideration has FDA made concerning the selection of suitable animal models for pharmacology, biodistribution and other safety studies for modRNA products encoding antigens whose interaction with host ligands may be species specific?

<p>When asked about the kinetics of spike protein production at the June 15 2022 VRBPAC meeting, the Pfizer representative dismissed the question as “somewhat academic.” We disagree. Central to understanding the pharmacology and toxicology of the modRNA vaccines is a consideration of </p>
<p>the biodistribution of the vaccines and their components (including residual DNA)</p>
<p>spike protein expression and distribution kinetics.</p>
<p>transfection of the LNP and mRNA release into the cytosol</p>
<p>The terms “biodistribution” and “transfection” must be clearly distinguished from “gene expression.” (161) Biodistribution refers to the physical location of a drug, tracer, or intact LNP within a biological system. It depends on circulation, the protein corona, vascular permeability, and reticular endothelial system (RES) uptake but does not indicate cell entry. Transfection is the process of delivering nucleic acids, such as modRNA. It requires both cellular uptake and endosomal release. In contrast, gene expression involves translating the modRNA into the target protein, such as the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This process depends on the intact modRNA, active ribosomes, and protection from degradation. It is important to recognize that the inherent instability of LNPs, combined with degradation, opsonization, and various biological barriers, can cause modRNA shearing, premature release, or even LNP disassembly, which can significantly reduce their therapeutic effectiveness. (162) </p>
<h1 id="discrepancies-between-messaging-and-data-on-modrna"><span class="underline"><strong>Discrepancies between messaging and data on modRNA, spike persistence and distribution</strong></span></h1>
<p>As discussed earlier (‎4.3.1), public health agencies have argued that “the mRNA is destroyed.” This is reflected in the messaging behind CDC’s vaccination campaign, shown in this screen shot (Figure 15) from the CDC web site</p>
<div class="image-container">
<img src="WisemanGutschi2025FDAIntrospection091325_images/image30.png" alt="Document image image30.png" />
</div>
<p>Figure 15: Screen shot from CDC web site: “do not last long”</p>
<p>This page represents that the vaccinal modRNA is eliminated within a few days, and the spike protein within a few weeks after vaccination. This information is inconsistent with emerging reports that extend these estimates to weeks or months for both modRNA (72,73,75) and spike protein (74,75,163) (see also review in (78)).</p>
<p>Another point of variance between public health messaging and available data is that modRNA distributes far more widely than represented. This screen shot from the same CDC web page fails to disclose the wide distribution known from animal studies conducted by Pfizer (160,164,165) and Moderna (136), conveying the impression that the vaccine “stays in the arm muscle.”</p>

<p>Figure 16: Screen shot from CDC web site: enters muscle cells (highlight added)</p>
<p>Although much was known about (164,165) about the distribution of LNPs, the discrepancy between what was represented and what is now known appears was exacerbated due to the non-conduct of adequately informative pharmacokinetic studies. Limited non-clinical studies were performed with vaccine prototypes whose composition differed from the candidate COVID-19 modRNA vaccines. No clinical pharmacokinetics studies appear to have been performed, based on the content of sponsor and FDA VRBPAC briefing documents or review memoranda for Pfizer (166-168) and Moderna.(169-171)</p>
<p>The non-conduct of critical studies appears to have been justified by:</p>
<p>unsupported expectations about modRNA, protein production (or gene expression) and LNP kinetics</p>
<p>a failure to follow guideline provisions for case-by-case consideration</p>
<p>a superficial analysis of the limited studies that were performed, lacking follow up</p>
<p> An inappropriate reading of WHO guidelines (in Pfizer’s  non-clinical overview(160) that “Pharmacokinetic studies have not been conducted with BNT162b2 and are generally not considered necessary to support the development and licensure of vaccine products for infectious diseases (WHO, 2005; WHO, 2014).””</p>

<p>Pfizer’s non-clinical overview from February 2021 released under FOIA states (p20/36): “The protein encoded by the RNA in BNT162b2 is expected to be proteolytically degraded like other endogenous proteins. RNA is degraded by cellular RNases and subjected to nucleic acid metabolism. Nucleotide metabolism occurs continuously within the cell, with the nucleoside being degraded to waste products and excreted or recycled for nucleotide synthesis. Therefore, no RNA or protein metabolism or excretion studies will be conducted.”(160) (emphasis added)</p>

<p>Pfizer’s expectations are mirrored by WHO’s similarly unsupported contention in their 2021 guideline on mRNA vaccines:(71) </p>

<h1 id="unsupported-expectations-about-local-distribution-"><span class="underline"><strong>Unsupported expectations about l</strong></span><span class="underline"><strong>ocal distribution and action</strong></span></h1>
<p>Another expectation supporting the non-conduct of pharmacokinetic studies concerns the notion that vaccines or their adjuvants remain or act locally, found in the following WHO guidelines. (172) (48) </p>
<p>The 2014 WHO guidelines on adjuvanted vaccines (172) state with some qualification: “Adjuvants are expected to exert their action locally in close connection to the antigen. However, biodistribution studies can be helpful in understanding the distribution of the adjuvant following injection” (p26/42) (emphasis added).</p>
<p>The 2021 WHO guideline on DNA plasmid vaccines (48) discounts the need for distribution studies: “Although biodistribution studies were previously suggested for DNA vaccines, the data acquired to date have not shown reason to continue with such evaluations. Plasmid DNA remains largely at the injection site and does not biodistribute at clinically relevant levels or widely throughout the body. Furthermore, it does not target the ovaries or testes and clears from the body by degradation.” (p32/54) (emphasis added, citations omitted)</p>

<p>Limited non-clinical PK studies were performed with modRNA vaccine prototypes whose compositions differed from the candidate COVID-19 modRNA vaccines for which no studies were reported.</p>
<p>The principal difference between the tested and candidate vaccines was in the sequence of the modRNA payload carried by the LNPs. Other differences are largely unknown in terms of method of manufacture, nucleoside modification, codon optimization, amounts and types of impurities and contaminants. Small differences in LNP composition, physicochemical attributes or manufacturer may impact a number of properties, including distribution.(67)</p>
<p>A major goal in conducting PK studies is to characterize the distribution, production, and persistence of the spike protein, as these factors presumably relate to the extent and type of immune response it will trigger. Spike PK properties depend on modRNA PK and expression characteristics, which in turn depend on LNP PK properties. Understanding the PK and expression properties of the spike protein, modRNA, and LNPs is essential, as discussed by Vervaeke et al. (173) Additionally, the PK properties of residual DNA or other impurities must be understood to inform about potential risks (see Question 86).</p>
<p>Aside from the tenuous expectations as to spike or modRNA persistence and distribution,(‎11.2.1) localization (‎11.2.2) or generous interpretation of guidelines, (‎11.3) another reason why regulators have accepted PK studies involving LNP vaccines carrying non-candidate modRNA is, as expressed in FDA’s “Summary Basis for Regulatory Action” for SPIKEVAX, that “Because biodistribution and retention is a property of the LNP rather than the mRNA, results from this study were considered supportive for the approval of SPIKEVAX BLA.” (p14/30) (151) </p>
<p>FDA’s statement reaches further than did Moderna’s nonclinical review: “The distribution, toxicity, and genotoxicity associated with mRNA vaccines formulated in LNPs are driven primarily by the composition of the LNPs and, to a lesser extent, by the biologic activity of the antigen(s) encoded by the mRNA.” (pp 316 and 676 in (174)) Likewise EMA’s assessment report (136) did not paint the same picture as FDA of distribution of mRNA being the sole property of the LNP:</p>
<p>“It is biologically plausible that the distribution of the mRNA vaccine is determined by the lipid nanoparticle content, whereas the influence of the mRNA itself is considered very limited. Therefore, it is acceptable that the biodistribution study was performed with the same lipid nanoparticles containing another mRNA (i.e. mRNA-1647).“ (p47/169)</p>
<p>This premise, underlying a platform approach, is open to significant challenge.</p>
<p>LNPs constitute a delivery method for modRNA, much like a buffer solution in a hypodermic syringe is a system for delivering drugs. The initial phases of distribution must certainly be highly dependent on the properties of the delivery system (physicochemical properties such as particle size, payload, composition etc. for LNPs, buffer composition needle size and administration rate for the syringe). The general chemistry of mRNA will likely determine to a large degree its general distributive properties. However, a close inspection of Moderna’s study reveals that although PK parameters for six different CMV mRNAs (131) delivered in the same LNPs were mostly (but not always) similar at the injection site and neighboring lymph nodes. up to 12-fold differences in key pharmacokinetic parameters between the different mRNA constructs in other tissues. (see ‎11.4.2).</p>
<p>The assertion that “biodistribution and retention is a property of the LNP rather than the mRNA” is further misleading because it fails to address how pattern of protein expression may differ with different mRNA constructs, in different formulations.</p>
<p>That the distribution of mRNA delivered by LNP may be partly dependent on the sequence of its modRNA payload is suggested by work conducted by BioNTech in which the distribution of modRNA delivered by liposomes was dependent on the modRNA sequence, particularly that of the 3’ UTR (175)</p>
<p>RNA stability is dependent on a number of features such as splicing patterns, transcript length, and G+C content,(176) not to mention of course nucleoside modification with N1 methylpseudouridine.</p>
<p>The distribution of the encoded protein will depend on its own biochemistry. A recent review (78) pointed out how results from Pfizer’s studies (‎11.5) on the kinetics of luciferase mRNA expression measured by bioluminescence would not model the distribution of spike protein which is a transmembrane protein that can circulate within episomes. Furthermore, the duration of luciferase expression may not be representative of the duration of spike protein expression</p>
<p>The validity of this premise not only affects the applicability of PK studies conducted with non-candidate versions of modRNA vaccines, it affects the relevance of most other non-clinical studies where these materials are used as test articles. These submissions only provide (albeit inadequate) biodistribution data and lack information on transfection or gene expression, which does not accurately reflect the true nature of these modRNA-LNP vaccines.</p>

<p>In Pfizer’s non-clinical overview (160) the non-conduct of pharmacokinetic studies on the BNT162b2 candidate was justified because they “are generally not considered necessary to support the development and licensure of vaccine products for infectious diseases,” (p17/36) citing guideline documents from WHO issued in 2005 (177) and 2014.(172) A closer inspection of these two documents reveals how the term “generally not considered necessary” has been generously construed.</p>
<p>The first of these, the 2005 document (177) addressing vaccines points to the need to consider these sorts of studies on a case-by-case basis when new formulations or adjuvants are involved: </p>
<p>“Pharmacokinetic studies (e.g. for determining serum or tissue concentrations of vaccine components) are normally not needed. The need for specific studies should be considered on a case-by-case basis (e.g. when using novel adjuvants or alternative routes of administration) and may include local deposition studies that would assess the retention of the vaccine component at the site of injection and its further distribution (e.g. to the draining lymph nodes). Distribution studies should be considered in the case of new formulations, novel adjuvants or when alternative routes of administration are intended to be used (e.g. oral or intranasal).” (p21/36) (emphasis added)</p>
<p>The second, 2014, document addressing vaccine adjuvants and adjuvanted vaccines (172) also points to a case-by-case consideration: “The feasibility of and need for such biodistribution studies should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.” (p26/42) (emphasis added)</p>
<p>The guidelines (172,177) cited by Pfizer (160) to justify the non-conduct of pharmacokinetic studies because they “are generally not considered necessary” contemplate traditional vaccines, with the typical “vaccine component” consisting of the target antigen or killed or attenuated target organism. These guidelines do not contemplate modRNA vaccines that elicit production of the ultimate antigen in the body of the vaccinee. These guidelines as well as those for adjuvants (172) and plasmid vaccines (48) do not contemplate delivery by a novel LNP formulation whose distribution (see below) clearly extends beyond the injection site.</p>
<p>Even if the WHO guidelines (172,177) could apply to modRNA vaccines rather than provide the implied blanket exemption for conducting pharmacokinetic studies of modRNA or spike antigen, both documents clearly speak of the need to consider these questions on a case-by-case basis, given the vaccines’ novelty. This has been circumvented by invoking “<span class="underline">generally</span> not considered necessary.” (emphasis added)</p>
<p>Regarding the kinetics of spike protein production, the use of this blanket exemption is all the more puzzling given that the WHO 2007 plasmid DNA guidelines (49) acknowledges: “Knowledge of the duration of expression of an antigen from injected DNA is limited although some reports suggest that expression could continue for many months, which means that the possibility of tolerance may remain a concern. (p19/25) (emphasis added)</p>

<p>FDA’s summary document for SPIKEVAX cited by Dr. Marks (151) (p14/30) notes the performance of a biodistribution study in rats of a vaccine of redacted identity. This study appears to correspond to study B1 (Table 1) described in the EMA document (136) on a similarly formulated CMV mRNA (mRNA 1647) vaccine containing 6 mRNAs, whose levels were measured directly. The EMA alluded (p47-48/169) to WHO guidelines on the general acceptability of not needing pharmacokinetic studies for vaccines (see ‎11.3) and acknowledged the need for distribution studies “in the case of new formulations or novel excipients used.” </p>

<p>In their paper, (128) Moderna’s scientists stated that the lipid-mRNA adducts “render the mRNA untranslatable, leading to loss of protein expression.” If one of the primary reasons for conducting a biodistribution study is to understand how and where in the body protein expression takes place, any characterization of distribution that is confounded by the presence of mRNA-lipid adducts is of extremely limited value. This has implications for any toxicology study performed on prototypes where mRNA-lipid adducts may have been involved. (see ‎12.3.4) Further, in the Fall of 2021, Pfizer’s implemented a change in the buffer of their COVID-19 mRNA vaccine from PBS to Tris. (see ‎8.2).</p>

<p>mRNA was found (p47/169 in (136)) at the muscle of the injection site, proximal and distal lymph nodes, spleen and, except the kidney, all examined tissues, including heart, lung, testis, and brain tissues. Although there is rapid clearance from the plasma in the first 24 hours with a t1/2 of 2.7 - 3.8 hours, the half-lives for clearance from injection site muscle, proximal and distal lymph nodes, and spleen for all modRNA vaccine components were 14.9, 34.8, 31.1 and 63.0 hours, respectively. This means that the maximum time for 90% elimination could be as long as approximately 9 days, already somewhat longer than “a few days.” (‎11.1)</p>
<p>Moderna’s pharmacokinetic summary stated that the “biodistribution of mRNA-based vaccines in LNPs is predicted to be driven by the LNP characteristics.” (p12/13 in (154)). Six different CMV mRNA constructs studied were said to exhibit “nearly identical pharmacokinetic behavior.” (p11/701) (131) Although, a relatively small fraction of the administered mRNA-1647 dose distributed to distant tissues, with generally similar kinetics, a closer examination of the PK data revealed up to 12 fold differences in key pharmacokinetic parameters between the different mRNA constructs for different organs (Table 3).</p>

<p>These data constitute an unintended experiment that effectively controls for between-LNP and between-animal variation by loading the six mRNA constructs in the same LNPs,  and injected into the same animals.</p>
<p>PK parameters for the six constructs at the injection site and the proximal and distal lymph nodes are mostly (not entirely, see Table 3) clustered tightly, perhaps unsurprisingly. In terms of the half-life of elimination from the injection site, the values for the six mRNA constructs cluster around 15 hours. For the proximal lymph nodes, they cluster around 35 hours. Accordingly, the time for 90% elimination is approximately 2-5 days, corresponding to CDC’s “few days” (‎11.1). Outside of these tissues there appears to be greater between-construct variability in PK parameters. In the spleen, the half-life is longer for all constructs, up to 83 hours for the gH construct, corresponding to a time to 90% elimination of approximately over 11 days.</p>

<p>These findings suggesting construct-dependent kinetics have implications for the reliance on toxicology studies performed with constructs unrelated to the candidate product to support licensure.

</div>
<p>These studies were conducted to evaluate the toxicity and distribution of the LNPs alone, as they were considered novel excipients. (136). Excipients are generally believed to have no physiological effect by themselves, since they function as carriers for the modRNA. Regulatory assessment of excipients in medicinal products (179) does not require a separate review process, such as pharmacokinetic (PK) studies. No biodistribution studies using the actual modRNA construct from the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine were included in the regulatory documents. As a result, there was no assessment of transfection efficiency or gene expression levels. This aligns with studies required for LNPs as excipients. Further clarification from regulatory authorities and manufacturers is needed to determine the necessary chemical, pharmacological, and toxicological studies for these lipids to obtain approval.(180) LNPs, or LNP components may in fact have adjuvant activity, as indicated by a 2022 FDA presentation, slide 20 of which states <em>“Ionizable cationic lipid […] Provides adjuvant activity to LNPs” </em><em>(181)</em><em> </em>Possessing adjuvant activity would trigger higher regulatory scrutiny.(172,182)</p>
<h1 id="superficial-analysis-of-limited-biodistribution-st"><span class="underline"><strong>Superficial analysis of limited biodistribution studies, lacking follow-up: Pfizer</strong></span></h1>
<p>In addition to studies on the lipid components, Pfizer conducted three limited biodistribution studies on the distribution of LNPs or the expression kinetics of a model payload - mRNA encoding for luciferase. The two studies involving IM injection are of most interest.</p>
<p>Study 18530 (164) of the distribution of radiolabeled LNPs in rats is extremely limited because it proceeded only for 48 hours, using a different mRNA (luciferase) and made by a process with unknown similarity to that used for commercial scale. The type of nucleoside modification, codon optimization and untranslated sequences are unknown. The study did not examine luciferase expression. The findings of LNP accumulation in a number of tissues, including, adrenal glands, bone marrow, liver, lymph nodes, ovaries, spleen, and to a smaller extent, testes, are concerning and controvert the expectation of localization expressed in the 2014 WHO document, (172) and should have triggered follow up investigation.</p>
<p>The same concerns about mRNA composition and manufacture apply to study R-20-0072 (p17/36 in (160)) of similarly loaded LNPs in mice. Unlike the previous study mRNA expression was examined, although the bioluminescence whole-body method is extremely crude showing distribution mainly to the liver and injection site. Nonetheless, the signal for luciferase expression remains above the control level even at 9 days (Figure 17).</p>

<p>It is evident that these studies are woefully inadequate to characterize and deconvolute the kinetics of LNP biodistribution, transfection, modRNA persistence, protein expression, and persistence.

<p>A full understanding of the pharmacokinetics of any drug is of course essential to understand its pharmacology and toxicology. This is not an academic nicety.

</div>
<p>The concerns about lipid adducts and the actual formulations used in these studies as well as the assumptions about exclusively LNP dependent distribution has implications for the interpretation of the toxicity and genotoxicity studies since adducts decrease spike protein production as they are non-functional yet have intrinsic toxicological effects (see ‎12.3.3 ‎12.3.3).</p>

<p>Responding to concerns about genomic integration of residual DNA into the genome, mutagenesis, and cancer risk. Dr. Marks made these two statements regarding the results of genotoxicity studies conducted in animals.</p>
<p><em>“Additionally, animal studies with the mRNA delivery technology done over the past decade show no evidence of genotoxicity.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Additionally, studies have been conducted in animals using the modified mRNA and lipid nanoparticle together that constitute the vaccine, including the minute quantities of residual DNA fragments left over after </em><em>DNAse</em><em> treatment during manufacturing, and demonstrate no evidence for genotoxicity from the vaccine</em>.” Footnote 3 to this statement contains two URLs, pointing to the “Summary Basis for Regulatory Action” documents for COMIRNATY (47) and SPIKEVAX. (151)</p>
<p>In summary, this response provides no evidence of any directly relevant genotoxicity studies being performed and is therefore wholly inadequate for the following reasons:</p>
<p>The document cited regarding COMIRNATY (47) contains no reference whatsoever to animal genotoxicity studies.</p>
<p>The document cited regarding SPIKEVAX (151) contains a reference to a rat micronucleus assay to evaluate <em>“the genotoxic potential of (b) (4) </em>[redacted]<em> mRNA in SM-102 LNP”</em> that <em>“revealed no genotoxic effects of SM-102 LNP.” </em>The identity of the mRNA studied is redacted, but EMA (136) and Moderna documents (152) describe micronucleus assays being performed on two mRNA vaccines – a luciferase model vaccine and ZIka virus. Several points emerge:</p>
<p>These studies were NOT performed as represented using <em>“</em><em>the modified mRNA and lipid nanoparticle together that constitute the vaccine.” </em></p>
<p>The pattern of distribution, and therefore toxicity after IV the dosing used in these studies may differ from the IM dosing used clinically. Only single doses were tested.</p>
<p>The EMA (136) and Moderna documents (152) described no evidence of genotoxicity from the luciferase study, consistent with the FDA document. (151). </p>
<p>The Zika mRNA vaccine study did, according to both Moderna and EMA, yield positive findings of statistically significant increases in micronucleated erythrocytes in both sexes. The possible validity of mitigating circumstances discussed by EMA that might account for these observations, does not detract from the fact that its absence from the body of evidence referenced by Dr. Marks  (151) to allay concerns serves only to heighten them and compounds reservations as to the integrity of regulatory process.</p>
<p>Because assumptions that distribution is almost exclusively LNP dependent and largely independent of mRNA sequence are at best tenuous (‎11.4.2), reliance on favorable toxicological and genotoxicity findings is not firmly grounded.</p>
<p>The rat micronucleus assay described in the cited SPIKEVAX document (151) and used to test the mystery mRNA is not an appropriate method of assessing risks of integration and mutagenicity, or, when used alone, carcinogenicity. Thus, even tests performed on the actual COVID-19 mRNA vaccine compositions would not address this concern.</p>
<p>Other documents (e.g. ‎12.2) indicate that carcinogenicity (COMIRMATY, SPIKEVAX), mutagenicity (SPIKEVAX) or genotoxicity (COMIRMATY) were not performed.</p>
<p>Any toxic or genotoxic effects of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines may potentially be related to the expressed spike protein. The distribution and kinetics of protein expression is therefore important to understand. As the spike protein is known to interact with the ACE-2 receptor, distribution, thus the use of animals in toxicity or genotoxicity whose ACE-2 is similar to that of a human is vital.</p>
<p>There is no discussion of the lenient interpretation of WHO guidelines concerning the conduct of genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies for vaccines (see ‎12.4).</p>
<p>FDA guidance on the factors to consider for carcinogenicity studies of pharmaceuticals have been discounted (see ‎12.1)</p>
<p>Before elaborating on these points, a brief review of the types of tests available and their relevance is worthwhile.</p>
<h1 id="what-kinds-of-tests-are-appropriate-to-assess-inte"><span class="underline"><strong>What kinds of tests are appropriate to assess </strong></span><span class="underline"><strong>integration, </strong></span><span class="underline"><strong>mutagenicity</strong></span><span class="underline"><strong> or carcinogenicity</strong></span><span class="underline"><strong> </strong></span><span class="underline"><strong>risk?</strong></span></h1>
<p>FDA has defined genotoxicity, also called “g<em>enetic toxicity” </em>(183) as: “<em>A broad term that refers to any deleterious change in the genetic material regardless of the mechanism by which the change is induced.”  </em>(183,184) </p>
<p>The genotoxic potential of a substance refers to its clastogenic, aneugenic, or mutagenic potential. (p6/17 in (185)) Clastogens are compounds that cause DNA strand breaks. Aneugens cause aneuploidy, the state of having an abnormal number of chromosomes. (186) Mutagens are substances that induce point mutations in DNA.(185) </p>
<p>The 2012 FDA guidance defines genotoxicity tests as <em>“in vitro and in vivo tests designed to detect compounds that induce genetic damage by various mechanisms.”</em> p6/35 (187) This and related documents (188) describe a standard battery of studies designed to identify genotoxic hazards consisting of:</p>
<p>in vitro and in vitro assessment of chromosomal damage – including in vitro and in vivo micronucleus assays,</p>
<p>Both clastogens and aneugens can be detected (and distinguished) in a micronucleus test (186) which also detects spindle poisons.(189,190) This type of test is not used to assess mutagenicity</p>
<p>A test for mutagenicity, commonly the bacterial reverse mutagenicity (Ames test),(191) which has been shown to detect the majority of genotoxic carcinogens in rodents and humans.(p7/35) (187) Limitations to the test are discussed in a 1997 FDA guidance (p7/12 in (135)) particularly where the test fails to provide <em>“appropriate or sufficient information for the assessment of genotoxicity,” </em>and where other types of test should also be performed. Several other mutagenicity tests have been characterized.(192)</p>
<p>Although well characterized, these tests can sometimes yield equivocal results with poor reproducibility or with questionable biological significance. The interpretation of these sorts of data is a complex matter, discussed in FDA guidance documents. (187,188)</p>
<p>The concern that a genotoxic substance may also be a carcinogen is not without foundation. FDA’s 1996 guidance (193) states: “<em>Unequivocally genotoxic compounds, in the absence of other data, are presumed to be transspecies carcinogens, implying a hazard to humans.</em><em>” </em>(p5/7)<em> </em>The risk of carcinogenesis is typically assessed in long term rodent models or alternative methods of a shorter duration (p5/8 in (188)) along with genotoxicity and other types of data.(188,194)</p>
<p>Further discussion of how various guidelines were interpreted is found in section ‎12.4.</p>

<p>In short.: None to very few.</p>
<p>Dr. Marks stated<em>: “Additionally, </em><em><strong>studies have been conducted</strong></em><em> in animals </em><em><strong>using the modified mRNA and lipid nanoparticle together that constitute the vaccine</strong></em><em>, including the minute quantities of residual DNA fragments left over after </em><em>DNAse</em><em> treatment during manufacturing, and </em><em><strong>demonstrate no evidence for genotoxicity</strong></em><em> from the vaccine</em>.” (emphasis added)</p>
<p>This statement is contradicted by those in Pfizer’s nonclinical overview (160) (p29/36)</p>
<p><em>“</em><em>No genotoxicity studies are planned for BNT162b2 as the components of the vaccine construct are lipids and RNA and are not expected to have genotoxic potential (WHO, 2005)</em><em> […] </em><em> Carcinogenicity studies with BNT162b2 have not been conducted as the components of the vaccine construct are lipids and RNA and are not expected to have carcinogenic or tumorigenic potential. Carcinogenicity testing is generally not considered necessary to support the development and licensure of vaccine products for infectious diseases (WHO, 2005).</em><em>”</em></p>
<p>And in EMA’s EPAR assessment for Pfizer (p50/140 in (30))</p>
<p><em>“No genotoxicity studies have been provided. This is acceptable as the components of the vaccine formulation are lipids and RNA that are not expected to have genotoxic potential.”</em></p>
<p>This statement is also contradicted by the package inserts for the two modRNA products.</p>
<p>“COMIRNATY has not been evaluated for the potential to cause carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or impairment of male fertility.” :(15,16)</p>
<p>“SPIKEVAX has not been evaluated for carcinogenic, mutagenic potential, or impairment of male fertility in animals.” (17,195)</p>

<p>Dr. Marks’ footnote 3 points to the URLs for the “Summary Basis for Regulatory Action” for both COMIRNATY (47) and SPIKEVAX. (151)</p>
<p>Although the document cited for COMIRNATY (47) contains many redactions, the two relevant sections  “Nonclinical Pharmacology/Toxicology” and “Safety and Pharmacovigilance” were not redacted. There is no reference to animal genotoxicity studies anywhere in this cited document, that support the statement “no evidence for genotoxicity from the vaccine.” Genotoxicity studies were conducted on an excipient (see ‎12.3.2 ).</p>
<p>The document cited for SPIKEVAX similarly contains no reference to genotoxicity studies involving the “modified mRNA and lipid nanoparticle together that constitute the vaccine.” However, studies with excipients or other kinds of mRNA were conducted (see ‎12.3.3).</p>

<p>While it is appropriate and necessary in regulatory submissions to document “supportive studies” on test articles of related composition, or involving procedurally deficient studies, sufficient detail about the studies and the compositions tested must be provided in order to weight their relevance to the current COVID-19 modRNA vaccines.</p>
<p>Favorable supportive data, although not independently decisive, certainly adds confidence to a favorable risk assessment.

<p>Accordingly, how these sorts of differences are considered cannot be a “one way” street. They cannot be effectively minimized when favorable supportive data bolsters confidence in an approval or authorization, but emphasized when unfavorable “supportive” impugns such confidence.</p>

<a href="#q188"><strong>Question 188:</strong></a> Question 188: Which nonclinical studies have FDA requested from Pfizer of Moderna to rectify the quality and quantity of the limited studies relied upon under EUA conditions, but would have been insufficient in non-pandemic conditions?
</div>
<p>Several questions were asked earlier (‎3.6) regarding the studies involving COVID-19 modRNA prototypes. Supportive studies on non-COVID-19 modRNA products as well as vaccine ingredients, focusing on genotoxicity will now be considered, followed by other nonclinical studies.</p>
<h1 id="what-genotoxicity-studies-were-performed-on-comirn"><span class="underline"><strong>What genotoxicity studies </strong></span><span class="underline"><strong>were </strong></span><span class="underline"><strong>performed on </strong></span><span class="underline"><strong>COMIRNATY </strong></span><span class="underline"><strong>ingredients</strong></span><span class="underline"><strong> or related modRNA products?</strong></span></h1>
<p>With a product as complex as the modRNA or adenovirus vector COVID-19 vaccines, involving DNA, RNA, lipid components spike protein, and lipid-adducts, ‎8.1) the multi-hit hypothesis of oncogenesis must be considered.(196)</p>
<p>It is surprising that, as described above no genotoxicity studies were conducted on COMIRNATY, or at least provided, as the EMA’s assessment report for COMIRNATY (30) states: “No genotoxicity studies have been provided. This is acceptable as the components of the vaccine formulation are lipids and RNA that are not expected to have genotoxic potential.” (p50/140)(emphasis added) This report notes a low genotoxic risk with one of the ingredients that constitute the LNP:</p>
<p><em>“The novel excipient ALC-0159 contains a potential acetamide moiety. Risk assessment performed by the Applicant indicates that the risk of genotoxicity relating to this excipient is very low based on literature data where acetamide genotoxicity is associated with high doses and chronic administration (≥1000 mg/kg/day). Since the amount of ALC-0159 excipient in the finished product is low (50 </em><em>μg</em><em>/dose), its clearance is high and only two administrations of the product are recommended for humans, the genotoxicity risk is expected to be very low.” </em>(p50/140)</p>
<p>The absence of genotoxicity or carcinogenesis studies is reflected in the package inserts for COMIRNATY(16) <em>“COMIRNATY has not been evaluated for the potential to cause carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or impairment of male fertility”</em> and SPIKEVAX.(195) <em>“SPIKEVAX has not been evaluated for carcinogenic, mutagenic potential, or impairment of male fertility in animals.”</em></p>
<div class="question" id="q189">
<a href="#q189"><strong>Question 189:</strong></a> Question 189: While the dose of ALC-0159 appears to be low compared with the doses associated with genotoxicity (according to the EMA report), what consideration was given to a possible synergistic effect of sub-genotoxic threshold levels of this component with other vaccine components?
</div>
<p>Discussion beyond the scope of this document is required on the issue of how LNPs or their components should be defined or regulated as excipients in the context of contributing to a nanotechnology.(180,197,198)(see also ‎11.4.2)</p>

<p>The number and description of the studies enumerated in this FDA document (151) (Figure 13) do not match with those given in Moderna’s nonclinical overview (152) or the EMA assessment report for the Moderna product. (136) It appears that potentially unfavorable supportive data were not disclosed or adequately described in the FDA document. (151)</p>
<p>To compare the FDA, EMA and Moderna accounts, Table 1 of the EMA document (p43/169) has been reproduced in Table 1. (see ‎10.1) Not included are seven pharmacology studies, of which six were identified as involving mRNA-1273, Moderna’s candidate COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
<p>The following Table 4 attempts to reconcile the differences between the numbers and descriptions of studies found in the two documents. The left column contains the clause-by-clause text of the paragraph under “Other Supportive Toxicology Studies” on p14/30 of the cited FDA document. (151) The right column attempts to reconcile each clause with the EMA document. More detailed discussion is given below.</p>

<p>The FDA document erroneously describes the rat micronucleus test as being an <em>in vitro</em>, not an <em>in vivo</em> test (compare with p50/169 of (136)). As discussed above (‎12.1), this assay is not an appropriate or adequate method of assessing integration, mutagenicity, or carcinogenicity. Thus, even if it were performed on the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, it would not address concerns about integration.</p>
<p>The FDA document describes only one test of this kind, on an mRNA with redacted identity. The EMA report documents <span class="underline"><strong>two</strong></span> rat micronucleus studies (G3, G4 in Table 1) and the mRNA types as Zika (G3) and luciferase mRNA (G4). This is confirmed in Moderna’s nonclinical overview obtained under FOIA. (152)</p>
<div class="question" id="q190">
<a href="#q190"><strong>Question 190:</strong></a> Question 190: Please confirm the identity of mystery mRNA. To the extent that redaction ever qualified for a (b)(4) exemption, the matter has already been publicly disclosed in the EMA and Moderna documents.

<div class="question" id="q191">
<a href="#q191"><strong>Question 191:</strong></a> Question 191: Please explain the reason why the genotoxicity study with the “other” mRNA was not described FDA’s document. (151) FDA’s omission does not appear to be a failure by Moderna to report the study to FDA. (152)
</div>
<p>The Moderna overview (152)(p21/31) noted that in the luciferase study (G4 in Table 1) the results were determined to be negative. The EMA document (136) noted that test article was <em>“determined to be negative (non-clastogenic</em><em>,</em><em>)”</em> (p50/169) further noting a transient, non-dose dependent <em>“statistically significant decrease in poly</em><em>	</em><em>chromatic erythrocytes”</em> in the low dose group in male rats (p50/169 in (136)).<em><strong> </strong></em>The EMA report also noted cytokine increases and referred to other studies showing cytokine release after IM dosing of mRNA-1273 in primates (p50/169). Moderna’s overview (152) documented that this study was not GLP compliant (p18/31), FDA failed to mention this, and the EMA were under the impression that this study was GLP-compliant.</p>
<p>Moderna (p21/31) (152) noted positive findings in the Zika mRNA study (G3 in Table 1) with EMA providing more detail, noting a <em>“statistically significant increases in </em><em>micronucleated</em><em> erythrocytes were reported in both sexes. A strong increase in Molecular initiating event (MIE) was observed 48 hours after the final administration in the highest dose group in male rats […]. No clear dose-response relationship was reported.”</em> (p50/169 in (136)).</p>
<p>Qualifying these findings, (p50/169) the EMA noted that non-genotoxic effects observed in toxicological studies could cause or contribute to the increase of micronucleated erythrocytes and could: affect clearance of micronucleated cells from the blood; elicit hyperthermia, increase splenic inflammation, and disturb erythropoiesis (lower reticulocyte count, higher red blood cell distribution width). Although the study details appear unavailable (see Question 209) the effects on erythropoiesis are unclear, but a lower reticulocyte count seen in the toxicological studies appears consistent with decreased numbers of polychromatic erythrocytes noted in the luciferase genotoxicity study. However, it is unclear from the limited detail available, how reductions in reticulocytes and polychromatic cells are mechanistically related to an increase in micronucleated cells.</p>
<div class="question" id="q192">

<a href="#q194"><strong>Question 194:</strong></a> Question 194: Do reductions in reticulocytes and polychromatic cells, as well as disturbances in erythropoiesis raise any concerns for bone marrow toxicity? What follow up studies or risk analysis has FDA requested on this topic?
</div>
<p>The EMA, in considering these studies as well as other factors such as dosing concluded that <em>“Taking all these data together, a relevant genotoxic risk is thus not expected for mRNA-1273.”</em> (p 55/169)(136)</p>
<p>Moderna’s approach was similar, although providing no comment on the effects seen on reticulocytes, polychromatic cells and erythropoiesis:</p>
<p>“The equivocal results are likely driven by micronuclei formation secondary to increased cytokines and/or body temperature induced by LNP-driven systemic inflammation at high systemic (intravenous) doses. Overall, the genotoxic risk to humans is considered to be low due to minimal systemic exposure following IM administration, limited duration of exposure, and negative in vitro results.” “(p21/31) (152)</p>
<p>Because assumptions that distribution is almost exclusively LNP dependent and largely independent of mRNA sequence are at best tenuous (‎11.4.2), reliance on favorable toxicological and genotoxicity findings is not firmly grounded.</p>
<p>In sum, the studies described fail to <em>“demonstrate no evidence for genotoxicity from the vaccine</em><em>,” </em>as represented. Rather, genotoxicity signals were observed but not disclosed in the FDA document (151) or in the Marks response. Although the studies were not performed on <em>“…the modified mRNA and lipid nanoparticle together that constitute the </em><em>vaccine,“</em><em> </em>as represented, the studies need to be fully reported regardless of any qualifying language. Even if the qualifying language is justified, the signal still contributes to the body of evidence related to concern for genotoxicity.</p>

</div>
<p>The FDA report notes the conduct of bacterial reverse mutation and in vitro mammalian cell micronucleus test on the PEG2000-DMG LNP component. However, the EMA document (Table 1, studies G1, G2) refers to these tests being conducted on the SM-102 component and not PEG2000-DMG. Moderna’s nonclinical overview (p17/31) (152) documents that these two assays were performed on each LNP ingredient, for a total of four genotoxicity tests.</p>

<p>Although these tests were conducted on LNP components and not Drug Product, subthreshold genotoxic potential may be additive or synergistic with any effects from other vaccine components or impurities.

<h1 id="questions-regarding-nonclinical-studies-other-than"><span class="underline"><strong>Q</strong></span><span class="underline"><strong>uestions regarding nonclinical studies other than genotoxicity</strong></span></h1>
<p>In reviewing the documents cite by Dr. Marks for COMIRNATY (47) and SPIKEVAX, (151) a number of questions arise regarding procedurally deficient or other supportive nonclinical studies. See also questions in section ‎3.6 regarding COVID-19 modRNA prototypes and section ‎12.3.1 on the relevance and reliance on supportive studies involving related modRNA products.</p>
<p>The six repeat dose toxicity studies on five Moderna vaccines referred to in the FDA document (151) as “supportive” correspond to studies T1-T6 identified in Table 1. The EMA (136) identifies two kinds of Zika, two kinds of CMV, and one hMPV/PIV3 mRNA product. The comparability with authorized product of method of manufacture, non-coding regions, codon optimization, use of N1-methyl pseudouridine and type and amount of impurities, is unknown. There are other formulation differences such as pH and buffer composition. In some of the studies the ingredient “PG” was used, but this abbreviation is not defined in the EMA document. (136)</p>
<div class="question" id="q209">

</div>
<p>None of the above studies involve an mRNA encoding for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. However, one non-GLP repeat-dose immunogenicity and toxicity study of mRNA-1273 in rats is described in the FDA document under the general heading “Nonclinical Pharmacology/Toxicology.” The FDA document notes that: “Findings from the intramuscular repeat dose rat toxicity study demonstrated that vaccine doses of up to 100 mcg (two doses given three weeks apart) were well-tolerated.”</p>
<p>This study appears to correspond with study T7 (Table 1) in the EMA document. However, absent from the FDA document is mention of “major procedural/ methodological limitations” (p48/169 in (136))) indicated in the EMA document.</p>
<p>“The product-specific Study 2308-123 was not conducted in GLP-compliance, and exhibits major procedural/methodological limitations.

<p>Some of Pfizer’s other nonclinical studies are described in EMA’s 2021 report (30) including a repeat dose toxicity study in rats (P49/140). “Large unstained cells,” presumably in blood, were observed, but EMA’s report noted that: <em>“</em><em>The applicant also informed that </em><em>characterisation</em><em> of large unstained cells was not conducted since the identification of these cells does not provide additional information.

<h1 id="generous-interpretation-of-who-guideline-vaccine-e"><span class="underline"><strong>Generous </strong></span><span class="underline"><strong>interpretation of WHO guideline</strong></span><span class="underline"><strong> vaccine exemption for </strong></span><span class="underline"><strong>genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies</strong></span></h1>
<p>A number of guidelines have been issued that speak to the sorts of genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies that might be required for these products. Ambiguous, or sometimes apparently conflicting statements, may have provided justification for the relative dearth of studies that were conducted.</p>
<p>Although not applying to biologics. The FDA guidance on genotoxicity testing (187)<em> </em>provides instructive general principles: <em>“Nevertheless, a battery approach is still reasonable because no single test is capable of detecting all genotoxic mechanisms relevant in tumorigenesis.”</em>(p<em>6/35</em>) The same can be said for a guidance on the mutagenicity of impurities<em> </em>(184)<em>  “Specifically, changes should be evaluated to determine if the changes result in any new mutagenic impurities or higher acceptance criteria for existing mutagenic impurities</em>.” (p9/38)</p>
<p>The 2007 WHO guideline on DNA vaccines (49) discusses the need for case-by-case consideration in the design of the nonclinical safety program, which should be performed on every novel vaccine: </p>
<p>“In designing the nonclinical safety programme for a DNA vaccine product, the 2007 WHO guidelines on nonclinical evaluation of vaccines should be consulted in addition to the guidance provided here. […]  Every product should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. As a general rule, nonclinical safety assessment should be performed on every novel vaccine or vaccine/adjuvant formulation.” (p20/25 in (49)) (emphasis added)</p>
<p>This same document (49) continues (p23/25) with an apparently mixed message: “The standard battery of genotoxicity and conventional carcinogenicity studies is not applicable to DNA vaccines. However, genotoxicity studies may be required to address a concern about a specific impurity or novel chemical component, e.g. a complexing material that has not been tested previously.”</p>
<p>Introducing a discussion of nonclinical evaluation of mRNA vaccines and citing the WHO 2005 (177) and 2014 (172) documents, the 2021 WHO guideline (71) lists a number of issues for which agreement should be reached with regulators on the types of nonclinical studies to be conducted, rather than reliance on a general exemptive rule.</p>
<p>“Because of the novelty of this product class and for the sake of inclusiveness, numerous issues are listed in this section. Not all of these issues will necessarily be relevant to mRNA vaccines, depending on their design. However, it is incumbent upon the vaccine developer/manufacturer to provide evidence demonstrating the proof-of-concept (for example, immunogenicity and challenge protection) and safety of their candidate vaccine. The types, design and number of studies expected should be agreed with the NRA.” (p45/66) Among the issues listed where this sort of agreement should be reached are “Biodistribution and persistence” studies. (p46/66 in (71))</p>
<p>There is no discussion of the lenient interpretation of WHO guidelines concerning the conduct of genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies for vaccines. Genotoxicity is mentioned with regard to LNPs, lipid and other novel excipients.</p>
<p><em>“d. Novel lipids and novel LNPs: because the lipids used to formulate the LNPs affect the overall charge of the particle, when using LNPs made with novel lipids or when the LNPs are themselves modified (for example, altered ratios or modified processes) and these LNPs have not previously been </em><em>nonclinically</em><em> and clinically tested in mRNA products encapsulated in LNPs then evaluation of the toxicity of the new formulation containing the novel lipids (or any novel excipients) may be required. Furthermore, the </em><em><strong>NRA may require that the genotoxicity and systemic toxicity</strong></em><em> of the novel lipid component be assessed, similar to the expectations for novel adjuvants set out in the WHO Guidelines on the nonclinical evaluation of vaccine adjuvants and adjuvanted vaccines (16) and/or those for new chemical entities in the ICH guideline S2 (R1)</em><em>”</em><em> </em>(58)<em>.</em></p>
<p><em>“</em><em>e. </em><em><strong>Novel formulations</strong></em><em>: likewise, for formulations (other than LNPs) containing novel excipients, data on and assessment of the </em><em><strong>systemic toxicity and genotoxicity</strong></em><em> of the formulation may be expected.”</em></p>
<p>A 2014 WHO guidance on adjuvants p27/42 (172) delivers a different message: <em>“</em><em>Genotoxicity studies are normally not needed for the final vaccine formulation (1). However, a standard battery of genotoxicity studies is generally </em><em>recommended for most novel adjuvants that are (or contain) new chemical entities (31, 37). Based on previous experience, carcinogenicity studies are generally not needed for adjuvants or adjuvanted vaccines.</em><em>”</em></p>
<p>An FDA 2010 guidance on cell substrates for vaccine production (63) (p38/50) states:</p>
<p><em>“If the presence of an oncogenic virus is suspected because of the cell phenotype or the origin of your cell substrate, we recommend that you perform oncogenicity testing in animals using lysates of the cell substrate. For cell substrates with a tumorigenic phenotype, we recommend that you perform oncogenicity testing in animals using DNA from the cell substrate in order to provide assurance that residual DNA is non-oncogenic (also see Section III.C.6). </em><em><strong>Oncogenicity testing might also be appropriate for some products with high quantities of residual cellular DNA</strong></em><em>.” </em>(emphasis added)</p>
<p>The FDA 1996 guidance (193) on the factors to consider for carcinogenicity studies of drugs has been discussed above, (‎12.1) particularly its statement (p<em>5/7) “ Unequivocally genotoxic compounds, in the absence of other data, are presumed to be transspecies carcinogens, implying a hazard to humans.”</em></p>
<p>The 2005 WHO guidance (177) on nonclinical evaluation of vaccines relied upon by Pfizer (section ‎12.2) states:</p>
<p>“<em>Genotoxicity studies are </em><em><strong>normally</strong></em><em> not needed for the final vaccine formulation. However, they may be required for particular vaccine components </em><em><strong>such as novel adjuvants and additives</strong></em><em>. If needed, the in vitro tests for mutations and chromosomal damage should be done prior to first human exposure.

<p>Similar to our discussion of the need for kinetics studies (‎11.2.3), this2005 WHO guideline speaks of classical vaccine antigens, not gene therapy based produced. It also states that these studies are not “normally” needed, but may be required for “<em>novel adjuvants and additives.”</em></p>
<p>Taken on its own, it appears this has been generously interpreted by Pfizer. Taking the totality of other guidelines described, even with some of the ambiguities, there appears to be little justification for the assertion that these studies were not needed.</p>

<p>Although not a subject of Dr. Ladapo’s concerns, this related matter warrants attention.</p>
<p>A paper was published by Mulroney <em>et al</em>.(209) in Nature entitled: <em>“</em><em>N1-methylpseudouridylation of mRNA causes +1 ribosomal frameshifting.”</em> The paper was accompanied by a press release (210) from the University of Cambridge whose scientists collaborated with others from the universities of Oxford, Liverpool and Dublin, and elsewhere. A number of these labs act as centers within the UK’s Medical Research Council (MRC) or National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR).</p>
<p>The authors synthesized a pool of peptides whose sequences were predicted by +1 shifts of the reading frame for spike protein in vaccinal BNT162b2 modRNA. Murine spleen and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were taken after vaccination with the Pfizer or Astra-Zeneca products and exposed to these frameshift peptides in an <em>in vitro</em> assay of T cell function. Cells from mice or humans previously vaccinated with the Pfizer but not the Astra-Zeneca product responded in this assay. According to the press release about a third of the people responded in this way, indicating that they had “seen” antigens resembling those peptides before.</p>
<p>The paper also discussed how frameshifting would likely elicit a family of chimeric proteins consisting of portions of in-frame and out of frame amino acid sequences. The authors showed that frameshifting was likely to occur at sites rich in N1-methylpseudouridine, engineered into the RNA to produce the “nucleoside modified” RNA (modRNA) to evade innate immune attack. Since the viral-vector DNA Astra-Zeneca vaccine did not contain this modification, no evidence of exposure to frameshift proteins was detected in the cells of mice or people given this product. Frameshifting in a model system occurred in approximately 10% of ribosomal reads which could be reduced by limiting the extent of N1-methylpseudouridylation at particular loci.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that <em>“these data suggest that vaccination with 1-methyl. mRNA can elicit cellular immunity to peptide antigens produced by +1 ribosomal frameshifting in both major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-diverse people and MHC-uniform mice.”</em></p>
<p>One of the authors was quoted (210) as saying: (emphasis added)</p>
<p><em>“We can remove the </em><em><strong>error-prone</strong></em><em> code from the mRNA in vaccines so the body will make the proteins we want for an immune response without inadvertently making other proteins as well. The safety concern for future mRNA medicines is that mis-directed immunity has </em><em><strong>huge potential to be harmful</strong></em><em>, so </em><em><strong>off-target immune responses</strong></em><em> should always be avoided.”</em></p>
<p>With this and similar statements, the authors state in the paper that <em>“Although there is no evidence that frameshifted products in humans generated from BNT162b2 vaccination are associated with adverse outcomes.</em>” This statement appears to be based on the observation that none of the 21 subjects providing samples had “<em>reported undue effects as a result of vaccination.”  </em>It is unclear how it is possible to draw any conclusions about the safety implications of the frameshifted proteins given that:</p>
<p>Only a small number of vaccinated subjects (n=21) provided samples for this study.</p>
<p>The use of subjects who had not reported adverse outcomes constitutes a selection bias.</p>
<p>This was not a controlled trial.</p>
<p>The stated premise for the study was: “<em>So far, no study has investigated the fundamental question of whether modified ribonucleotides can affect the maintenance of the correct reading frame during translation of a synthetic transcript.”</em><em> </em>If these authors were able to predict the existence of frameshifted proteins, why were Pfizer’s scientists unable to do so? Certainly, the possibility of <em>“cryptic proteins”</em> being translated from alternative out of frame open reading frames was known to the co-founder of Moderna in a 2016 paper. (p326 of (67))</p>
<p>The same question may be asked of regulators, especially in light of unresolved concerns raised by EMA (p137/140 in (30)) such as <em>“when present in the cell it cannot be excluded that different proteins than the intact full-length spike will be expressed” </em>as well as discrepancies reflected in EMA’s Specific Obligation regarding the identities of Western Blot (WB) bands obtained by <em>in vitro</em> expression assays.(30) (see ‎3.3 above). Could some of these bands represent chimeric proteins containing both frameshift regions and in-frame regions still capable of reacting with the anti-spike antibodies used in the Western blots? Could these bands represent other kinds of cryptic proteins (sometimes called cryptides or crypteins) such as those produced from alternate start sites (67,211) or proteolytic cleavage.(212)</p>
<p>According to 2021 WHO guidelines for mRNA vaccines, (71) manufacturers should provide details of “<em>unexpected ORFs” </em>(Open Reading Frames): <em>“The complete annotated sequence </em><em><strong>identifying all ORFs (including any unexpected ORFs)</strong></em><em> and all other sequence elements (including their justification for use) should be provided.”</em><em> </em>(p13/66)<em> </em>(emphasis added) Certainly, frameshifted sequences would qualify as “<em>unexpected ORFs</em><em><strong>”</strong></em></p>
<p>Although this study involved the Pfizer vaccine, due to the involvement of the same nucleoside modification deployed in the Moderna product, frameshifting is also likely for that product.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the covalent lipid–RNA adducts and truncated RNA contained within the LNPs reduce the effective mRNA dose available for translation. These modifications can also perturb ribosome progression, potentially also contributing to ribosomal frameshifting (~8% observed in Mulroney et al.), which may generate incomplete or altered proteins. At the same time, residual LNP components and misprocessed RNA fragments can potentially increase cellular stress and immunogenicity. (213) Together, these effects effectively narrow the therapeutic window of mRNA-LNP vaccines, creating a disconnect between nominal “dose” and functional antigen delivery.</p>

</div>
<p>FDA’s 2007 guidance on plasmid vaccines (64), although downplaying the likelihood of autoimmune reactions (see ‎4.6) noted “<em>Yet the possibility persists that DNA vaccines might idiosyncratically cause or worsen organ-specific autoimmunity by encoding antigens (including cryptic antigens) that cross-react with self.” </em>(p8/13)<em> </em></p>
<p>The document proposes (p8/13) a course of action in the event that “<em>an immune response is induced by a transgene product encoding self-antigen.”</em> (emphasis added)</p>
<p><em>“In cases where </em><em><strong>an immune response is induced by a transgene product</strong></em><em> </em><em><strong>encoding self-antigen</strong></em><em> (such as a cytokine, chemokine, surface receptor/ligand, or cryptic self-antigen),</em><em> </em><em>we recommend that you examine potential cross-reactivity with the corresponding endogenous protein. If a persistent immune response against an endogenous protein is detected, we recommend that you evaluate potential adverse effects by studying the analogous animal gene in a relevant animal model. We further recommend that you monitor whether an immune response against the self-antigen is elicited during the clinical trial, and carefully evaluate the effect of this response on trial participants.”</em></p>
<p>In this case where immune reactions have been detected to model frameshift proteins, a similar course of action is appropriate.</p>
<p>According to the Mulroney paper or its associated press release, the immune responses elicited by the “<em>unintended proteins</em>” could have a “<em>huge potential to be harmful” </em>with “<em>unintended side-effects.” </em>These responses are described as “<em>unintended,” “off-target,” or “mis-directed” </em>immune responses. Given the concern expressed by EMA, as well as the unknown homologies (<strong>	</strong>Question<strong> </strong><strong>232</strong>) between the frameshift proteins and known proteins, such immune responses could be autoimmune in nature.</p>

<p>FDA has previously failed to insist on the study and assessment of risk of the pharmacology and toxicology of novel spike protein heterotrimers forming after injection of the bivalent COVID-19 modRNA vaccines.(142) The evidence for the elicitation by modRNA COVID-19 vaccines of uncharacterized frameshift proteins represents a developmental and regulatory failure to ask fundamental questions that could affect the safety and effectiveness of, and confidence in, these products. This failure can hardly be consistent with the claims that the review of these products has met “rigorous scientific standards,”</p>
<p>As Dr. Marks noted, over a billion doses of the modRNA vaccines have been administered.

<p>(Adapted from (215)) The COVID-19 pro-vaccines meet FDA’s definition of gene therapy products. (216)</p>
<p>(emphasis added) <em>“Human gene therapy/gene transfer is </em><em><strong>the administration of nucleic acids</strong></em><em>, viruses, or genetically engineered microorganisms that mediate their effect by transcription and/or translation of the transferred genetic material, and/or by integrating into the host genome. Cells may be modified in these ways ex vivo for subsequent administration to the recipient, or </em><em><strong>altered in vivo by gene therapy products administered directly to the recipient</strong></em><em>.” </em></p>
<p>A similar expanded definition is given in FDA’s Guidance on Long Term Follow-Up After Administration of Human Gene Therapy Products.(217) Both this and an earlier guidance (218) for the “Preclinical Assessment of Investigational Cellular and Gene Therapy Products” states:</p>
<p><em>“This guidance does not apply to therapeutic vaccines for infectious disease indications that are typically reviewed in CBER/Office of Vaccines Research and Review (OVRR)”</em></p>
<p>Moderna, Inc., the maker of a mRNA Covid-19 vaccine, acknowledged in their 2Q 2020 SEC filing(219) thus <em>”Currently, mRNA is considered a gene therapy product by the FDA.” </em> Further, the founder of BioNTech in a 2014 paper(66) stated <em><strong>“</strong></em><em>One would expect the classification of an mRNA drug to be a biologic, a gene therapy or a somatic cell </em><em>therapy.</em><em><strong>“</strong></em></p>
<p>Since these agents are Gene Therapy products, long term surveillance is warranted for delayed malignant, neurologic, autoimmune, hematologic, other disorders or effects on the genome or gene expression. This is reflected in FDA’s guidance document <em>“</em><em>Long Term Follow-up After Administration of Human Gene Therapy (GT) products.”</em>(217) The length of monitoring advised by FDA may be (emphasis added) “<span class="underline"><em><strong>as long as 15 years</strong></em></span><em> following exposure to the investigational GT product, specifying that the LTFU observation should include a </em><span class="underline"><em><strong>minimum of five years of annual examinations</strong></em></span><em>, followed by ten years of annual queries of study subjects, either in person or by questionnaire.”</em></p>
<p>Accordingly, the designation of these vaccines as Gene Therapy products is not merely a semantic nicety; rather it has regulatory consequences in terms of the long term follow up manufacturers should be required to conduct. </p>
<div class="question" id="q248">
<a href="#q248"><strong>Question 248:</strong></a> <strong>	</strong><strong>Question </strong><strong>248</strong>: Will FDA acknowledge the biological reality of these products and regulate them as gene therapies?
</div>
<h1 id="conclusion"><span class="underline"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h1>
<p>Dr. Marks stated:<em><strong> </strong></em><em>“We would like to make clear that based on a thorough assessment of the entire manufacturing process, FDA is confident in the quality, safety, and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines. The agency’s benefit-risk assessment and ongoing safety surveillance demonstrate that the benefits of their use outweigh their risks.”</em></p>
<p>It is difficult to share this confidence, given the analysis in this document, as well as our (DMW) recent analysis (204) of safety signal data that found evidence that hundreds of safety signals were missing from FDA’s EBDM analysis of VAERS data.</p>
<p>Our questions, although not intended to be exhaustive, reflect a concern that the available data are inconsistent with the central message of the public health COVID-19 vaccination campaign, which portrays the COVID-19 vaccines as <em>“meeting rigorous </em><em>scientific standards”</em> and as being established as “safe and effective.” These terms appear ubiquitously, for example, on CDC’s web site (220), representing that the <em>“vaccines are safe and effective” </em>and that they <em>“met the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) rigorous scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization (EUA).</em>”</p>
<p>As per statute and regulation, Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) (34) does not require a new drug to be established as “safe and effective” as in a conventional approval. Rather, an EUA requires a lower standard whereby “<em>based on the totality of the scientific evidence available, it is reasonable to believe that the product may be effective.”</em> The “totality” standard allows the FDA to consider evidence of a lower type or procedural or statistical quality not normally considered in a conventional approval.</p>
<p>The safety standard for an EUA requires that <em>“the known and potential benefits of the product, […] outweigh </em>[its]<em> known and potential </em><em>risks.</em>“ Uncertainties, irregularities, or deviations from normal accepted practice in the manufacturing process represent “potential risks” FDA was required to consider. It was not necessary to prove that DNA contamination, the SV40 sequence, or frameshifted proteins did caused harm, the mere fact of these phenomena constituted an uninvestigated potential risk FDA was legally required to consider when granting the EUAs.</p>
<p>Given the rapid launch of the COVID-19 pro-vaccines, manufacturing and safety testing standards needed to be tightened, not loosened as described here, adding potential, if not actual risk.</p>
<p>Generous interpretation of various guidelines, and the  word “expects” has been used by both sponsors and regulators  to justify why a certain test should not be done or a safeguard implemented, without providing detailed justification supporting the assertion, as in these examples: (bold added)</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“</em><em>mRNA vaccine is </em><em><strong>expected</strong></em><em> to remain in the cytoplasm</em><em>”</em> (‎4.3.1)(71)</li>
<li><em>“</em><em>residual DNA is </em><em><strong>expected</strong></em><em> to degrade rapidly and has a very low likelihood of reaching the nucleus</em><em>”</em> (126) </li>
</ul>
<p>“FDA expects that much of the manufacturing process and controls, as well as the facilities for vaccine production, for the modified COVID-19 vaccine will be identical to that of the prototype COVID-19 vaccine.” .(149) </p>
<ul>
<li><em>“The protein encoded by the RNA in BNT162b2 is </em><em><strong>expected</strong></em><em> to be proteolytically degraded like other endogenous proteins</em>.”(160) </li>
<li> <em>“Adjuvants are </em><em><strong>expected</strong></em><em> to exert their action locally</em><em> in close connection to the antigen.</em><em>”</em> (172)</li>
<li><em>“No genotoxicity studies are planned for BNT162b2 as the components of the vaccine construct are lipids and RNA and are not </em><em><strong>expected</strong></em><em> to have genotoxic potential (WHO, 2005) </em><em>“ </em>(160) </li>
</ul>
<p>The developmental and regulatory failure that the findings related to residual DNA and frameshift proteins represent are hardly evidence that these modRNA vaccines meet any “<em>rigorous scientific standards,” </em>and will no doubt erode further the trust in public health institutions. (221)</p>
<p>There are many more questions to ask. One critical area to consider, as described in a policy brief by Gutschi and Seger, (222) is the view that LNPs as passive excipients do not reflect their demonstrated biological activity, adjuvant-like properties, or unpredictable biodistribution. Regulatory frameworks must evolve to treat LNPs as active, bioactive, transfection agents, subject to the same level of scrutiny as other pharmacologically active agents.</p>
<p>We hope that the questions posed here will allow us to understand the potential harms associated with the modRNA pro-vaccines in a way that begins to restore the public trust in the scientific process and health institutions, by engaging in a process of introspection and improvement of regulatory processes and decision-making.</p>
<p>These expedited and still experimental vaccines are the most complicated medical products ever deployed. Pfizer’s recently retired head of vaccine research, Dr. Kathrin Jansen, was quoted in Nature as saying <em>““We flew the </em><em>aeroplane</em><em> while we were still building it.” </em>(223) </p>
<p>It is now time to ground the plane pending the answers to these, and no doubt, many more questions.</p>

<th>Figure 5: Figure 1C and legend from Domazet-Lošo (80)<br><em>“Hypothetical L1-mediated </em><em>retroposition</em><em> of vaccine mRNA. Vaccine mRNA formulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) enter the cell via endocytosis. A fraction of the vaccine mRNA enters the cytosol via endosomal escape, while the rest of the vaccine mRNA undergoes degradation in endosomes or is repackaged in multivesicular endosomes into extracellular </em><em>vesicles</em><em> (EVs) and secreted back into the extracellular space. The neighboring or distant cells can uptake vaccine mRNA from these EVs. L1 proteins (ORF1p and ORF2p) interact with vaccine mRNA via a process termed trans-association to form a vaccine mRNA ribonucleoprotein particle (vaccine mRNA RNP). Like L1 and parental gene RNPs, a vaccine mRNA RNP enters the nucleus where the vaccine mRNA, through TPRT, is reverse-transcribed and integrated into the genome. The poly-A tail of vaccine mRNA plays a crucial role in this process.” </em>(in text citations removed)</th>

The other studies T3, T4, T5, and T6 also used LIP4 in addition to “PG” which abbreviation is undefined, but possibly indicates polyethylene glycol (PEG).<br>There are other formulation differences such as pH and buffer composition.
