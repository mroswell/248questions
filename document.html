      Background
     </span>
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     On December 6, 2023, Florida
Surgeon General Ladapo wrote to the then FDA Commissioner and CDC Director
Cohen of CDC, raising concerns about the COVID-19 pro-vaccines, particularly
related to DNA contamination and the presence, in the Pfizer product, of an
SV40 promotor-enhancer-ori sequence. These findings were confirmed by a number
of labs, by regulators, or documents obtained under the Freedom of Information
Act.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     A response was furnished by FDA,
which formed the basis for subsequent responses to questions regarding DNA
contamination and other manufacturing and safety testing issues, including
frameshift proteins.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     <span>
      Method
     </span>
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     This document is written in the
form of a point-by-point critique to this response, with several additional
issues identified. Along with explanatory text, this document contains 248
questions to FDA.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     <span>
      Findings
     </span>
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     The safety
standard for an EUA requires that
     <i>
      “the known and potential benefits of the
product, […] outweigh
     </i>
     [its]
     <i>
      known and potential risks.
     </i>
     “ Uncertainties,
irregularities, or deviations from normal accepted practice in the
manufacturing process represent “potential risks” FDA was required to consider.
It was not necessary to prove that DNA contamination, the SV40 sequence, or
frameshifted proteins did caused harm, the mere fact of these phenomena
constituted an uninvestigated potential risk FDA was legally required to
consider when granting the EUAs.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     Given the rapid
launch of the COVID-19 pro-vaccines, manufacturing and safety testing standards
needed to be tightened, not loosened as described here, adding potential, if
not actual risk.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     Generous
interpretation of various guidelines, and the word “expects” has been used by
both sponsors and regulators
     to justify
why a certain test should not be done or a safeguard implemented, without
providing detailed justification supporting the assertion.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     We detail a
number of inconsistencies with statements made by regulators and data obtained
from public records, in one case we found an instance of an undeclared (by regulators)
genotoxicity study.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     The
developmental and regulatory failure that the findings related to residual DNA
and frameshift proteins represent, are hardly evidence that these modRNA
vaccines meet “
     <i>
      <span>
       rigorous scientific
standards,”
      </span>
     </i>
     <span>
      and
     </span>
     will no doubt
erode further the trust in public health institutions.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     <span>
      Conclusion
     </span>
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     We hope
that our questions will allow us to understand the potential harms associated
with the modRNA pro-vaccines in a way that begins to restore the public trust
in the scientific process and health institutions, by engaging in a process of
introspection and improvement of regulatory processes and decision-making.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     These
expedited and still experimental vaccines are the most complicated medical
products ever deployed. Pfizer’s recently retired head of vaccine research, Dr.
Kathrin Jansen, was quoted in Nature as saying
     <i>
      ““We flew the aeroplane while
we were still building it.”
     </i>
     It is now time to ground the plane pending the
answers to these, and no doubt, many more questions.

     to the then FDA Commissioner Califf
and CDC Director Cohen, raising concerns about the COVID-19 pro-vaccines,
particularly related to DNA contamination and the presence, in the Pfizer
product, of an SV40 promotor-enhancer-ori sequence, reported originally by
McKernan et al.

recent preprint.

    <span>
     <span>
      (4)
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     by then CBER Director Marks.
Rather than allaying his concerns, Dr. Ladapo believed that this response
served only to heighten them, prompting Dr, Ladapo to call for a halt in the use
of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines.

     Dr. Marks’ response has formed the
basis for subsequent responses to questions regarding DNA contamination since
then, despite the confirmation of findings of DNA contamination that exceeded
guidelines, and the presence of the SV40 sequences in the Pfizer product. This
confirmation has been furnished by laboratories around the world
    </span>
    <span>
     <span>
      (6-10)
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     and,
notably, by high school intern students working under FDA supervision.
    </span>
    <span>
     <span>
      (11)
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     Further, in numerous FOIA disclosures around the world, regulators have
confirmed the presence of the SV40 sequence (including the Marks response
    </span>
    <span>
     <span>
      (4)
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     ) and the fact that Pfizer had
chosen not to specifically disclose this regulatory sequence. Our own
unpublished work has confirmed this with the Pfizer 2024-2025 JN.1 formula.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     Since the Marks response has
formed the basis for FDA’s position on this topic, this document is written in
the form of a point-by-point challenge, along with additional points related to
safety testing or manufacturing of these products.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     Comments are provided on a
consolidated point-by-point basis, raising questions in text and provided in
list format the end of this document. While FDA is not bound by the actions of
regulatory agencies in other countries, by FDA’s citing WHO guidelines as well
as
     <i>
      “internationally agreed upon recommendations”
     </i>
    </span>
    <span>
     <span>
      (4)
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     we are justified in also citing
the deliberations of other regulators to inform our expectations of FDA’s
actions. Further, in many instances, FDA staff have played a major role in the
drafting of various WHO guidelines.
    </span>

   <p>
    <span>
     The term pro-vaccine is used here.
Unlike conventional vaccines, the modRNA products do not contain target
antigens. Rather they contain the genetic instructions that are read by a
patient’s body to produce the target spike protein antigen. This is somewhat
analogous to the activation of pro-drugs, molecules that lack the desired
pharmacologic action, but that are converted by the body to an active form.
    </span>
    <span>
     <span>
      (12)
     </span>
    </span>

     We employ the term “pro-vaccine”

signify this important distinction, which again has regulatory consequences.

    What is the regulatory status of Dr. Marks’ (4)statement regarding a“dramatic reduction in the risk of death, hospitalization and serious illness afforded by the vaccines”?

initial results from its pivotal trial of its COVID-19 vaccine in the NEJM on
December 10, 2020, the same day the VRBPAC was convened to discuss its
authorization. The protocol for the study was provided as an online supplement
to the publication. The protocol Amendment 7, in the version dated October 6,
2020 (p131/376)
     <i>
      “Added an additional exploratory objective to describe
safety and immunogenicity in participants 16 to 55 years of age vaccinated with
study intervention produced by manufacturing ‘Process 1’ or ‘Process 2.’

     The protocol elaborates (p174/376):
     <i>
      “The initial BNT162b2 was manufactured using “Process 1”, however “Process 2”
was developed to support increased scale of manufacture. In the study, each lot
of “Process 2” manufactured BNT162b2 will be administered to approximately 250
participants 16 to 55 years of age. The safety and immunogenicity of
prophylactic BNT162b2 in individuals 16 to 55 years of age vaccinated with “Process

     It is now public knowledge that Pfizer’s
Process 1 used a DNA template generated by a PCR method, with likely minimal
plasmid involvement. Switching to a plasmid –
     <i>
      E. coli
     </i>
     -based Process 2 similar
to the one used by Moderna introduced the possibility of a very different
profile of potential impurities and contaminants. These included the starting burden
of residual DNA as a process related impurity, the types of DNA (e.g. plasmid
sequence elements such as promoters, enhancers, and antibiotic resistance
genes), and DNA and endotoxin contaminants from the
     <i>
      E. coli
     </i>
     . Certainly
EMA in their February 19 2021 assessment of the Pfizer product noted (p16/140) that
this change

substance”

    <span>
     These sorts of process changes
introduced a new risk profile to the drug product, that in non-pandemic
circumstances would have triggered at least a risk assessment, and possibly an
appropriately sized clinical comparability study. FDA’s own guidance entitled
     <i>
      “Q5E
Comparability of Biotechnological/Biological Products Subject to Changes in
Their Manufacturing Process”
     </i>
    </span>
    <span>
     <span>
      (31)
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     instructively provides some
general principles by which comparability should be determined (emphasis
added):
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span>
      “A determination of comparability
can be based on a combination of analytical testing, biological assays, and, in
some cases, nonclinical and clinical data. If a manufacturer can provide
assurance of comparability through analytical studies alone, nonclinical or
clinical studies with the postchange product are not warranted. However,
      <b>
       where
the relationship between specific quality attributes and safety and efficacy
has not been established
      </b>
      , and differences between quality attributes of the
pre- and postchange product are observed, it might be appropriate to include a
combination of quality, nonclinical, and/or clinical studies in the
comparability exercise.”
     </span>
    </i>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     The emboldened clause certainly
applies to the modRNA vaccines. Given the necessity for clinical data, to
estimate the size of such a study, FDA’s June 2020 guidance
     <i>
      “Development and
Licensure of Vaccines to Prevent COVID-19”
     </i>
    </span>
    <span>
     <span>
      (32)
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     is instructive:
     <i>
      “The
pre-licensure safety database for preventive vaccines for infectious diseases
typically consists of at least 3,000 study participants vaccinated with the
dosing regimen intended for licensure.”
     </i>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     This is a far cry from an analysis
that is merely “
     <i>
      exploratory
     </i>
     ,”
     <i>
      “descriptive”
     </i>
     and involves only 250
subjects per arm. Perhaps the discrepancy reflects FDA’s switch from the BLA
approach described in the June 2020 guidance
    </span>
    <span>
     <span>
      (32)
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     to an EUA approach in the October
guidance.
    </span>
    <span>
     <span>
      (33)
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     This switch
lowered the evidentiary bar from the BLA standard of
     <i>
      “established as safe
and effective”
     </i>
     based on
     <i>
      “substantial evidence” “consisting of adequate
and well-controlled investigations.”
     </i>
     to the EUA standard of
     <i>
      “believes may
be effective”
     </i>
     based on a
     <i>
      “totality of evidence”
     </i>
     not requiring
clinical studies at all.

   <p>
    <span>
     Further, an inadequately
characterized manufacturing change may have fallen foul of cGMP. This may have
been circumvented since. in a public health emergency, the
     <span>
      Secretary of the Department of Health and Human
Services may
      <i>
       “
      </i>
     </span>
     <i>
      authorize, with respect to an eligible product,
deviations from current good manufacturing practice requirements.”

     <span>
      (34)
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     This seems also to have been the
approach of EMA who issued a time-limited exemption regarding certain GMP
issues that were the subject of Major Objections. This exemption, along with
data submitted by Pfizer and the imposition of time-bound “Specific
Obligations” (binding conditions to the authorization)
    </span>
    <b>
     <i>
     </i>
    </b>
    <span>
     and “Recommendations” (not binding but
important considerations for future development) allowed EMA to lift the Major
Objections and issue its Conditional Market Authorization “
     <i>
      In view of the
declared Public Health Emergency of International Concern.”
     </i>

     If the Secretary of HHS did issue such
a waiver covering matters relating to this sort of process change, VRBPAC
members do not appear to have been fully informed either at the meeting of
December 10, or the meeting of October 22, 2020 which introduced the EUA framework.
FDA’s Dr. Jerry Weir described some of the differences between the cGMP
requirements for full (BLA) licensure and the “expectations” under EUA. With
the main differences relating to stability and lot release testing, Dr. Weir
explained that FDA expected complete details and validation of the
manufacturing process,
    </span>
    <span>
     <span>
      (35)
     </span>
    </span>

     further stating that “
     <i>
      The CMC expectations
are very similar for EUA use or licensure.”

     Given these representations, the
fact of this critical manufacturing change as well as the details of proposed

     Information about the Process 1 to

     <span>
      (30)
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     EMA (p34/140) notes the need to
demonstrate the biological, chemical and physical comparability of Drug
Substance (DS) and Drug Product (DP) produced by the two processes.
    </span>

     In relation to this and other issues, EMA (p137/140)

identified uncertainties can be addressed post-authorisation in the context of

     Dr. Marks’ letter
makes two statements concerning the removal of residual DNA:

   <p>
    <span>
     <span>
      ·
     </span>
    </span>

     “The
treatment of the products with DNAase also fragments any residual DNA template
that might be present after other manufacturing steps.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     No doubt these statements were intended to allay
concerns about residual DNA. Dr. Marks’ letter fails to acknowledge that
concerns persisted about residual DNA and the DNase digestion step, well past
Pfizer’s 2020 EUA and 2021 BLA as revealed in EMA documents.

     The words “robustness of the DNase

shot, the first redaction appears to signal “excess” or similar, or perhaps
“variable” or similar. The second redaction appears to be referring to some
quality deficiency in the DNase leading to concerning residual DNA levels.

     The document relates to an application by
Pfizer made on January 24 2022 to, inter alia, implement test procedures to
qualify DNase used in manufacturing, stemming from Recommendations 3 and 7, to
improve the robustness of the DNase digestion step, and therefore result in
consistently and acceptably lower levels of residual DNA.

the goal of each recommendation was only partly fulfilled. A revised submission

the quality of plasmids used in manufacture:

   <p>
    <span>
     “Then around 2015, we started
moving into the gene therapy area, specifically aav gene therapy. And we
started working with suppliers who had materials,
    </span>
    <span>
     and they were calling them GMP-like
    </span>
    <span>
     materials, all right, this is
    </span>
    <span>
     sort of
a brand new thing that started to pop up. It's not research grade, it's not
GMP. What does GMP like even mean?
    </span>
    <span>
     We could talk about that a
little more in the discussion section where they have some controls and you
need to have some oversight of that.
    </span>
    <span>
     What's
the quality of that material?
    </span>
    <span>
     You're going to take a lot of
time with supplier knowledge and scientific justification to sort of figure
that out. This is when we were working with supplier. Then we started moving
internally and making our own stuff, and we had a mix of these different
materials. Again, there was a lot of phase-appropriate scientific
justification, a lot of discussions about that for this, again, for the gene
therapy.
    </span>
    <span>
     Then in 2020, everyone's well
aware, we were able to pivot our pipeline from not just gene therapy to mRNA.
    </span>
    <span>
     And there was a whole separate new group of questions that we had to ask
ourselves.”
    </span>

   <p>
    <span>
     Mr. Thompson
revealed that around 2015 suppliers were providing “GMP-like” grade plasmid.
From the context of the transcript and the accompanying slide below, it is
clear that in 2020 for mRNA manufacturing “GMP-like” plasmid was being used.

     and speculating

     provides an interesting historical perspective on risk
assessment related to residual DNA. (p8/110)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     In the 1970’s
as a result of a clinical research need, interferon alpha
    </span>
    <span>
     (IFN-α)
    </span>
    <span>
     was produced in a tumor line whose cells contained the
Epstein-Barr virus genome. With a concern that viral DNA could be transmitted
in whole or part to patients, regulatory agencies in several countries
authorized human clinical studies and eventually approved an
    </span>
    <span>
     IFN-α product
    </span>
    <span>
     . Contributing to those decisions and the risk-benefit
consideration was the fact that the product was being used for therapeutic
rather than prophylactic purposes, and that a validated purification process along
with assays that could show that DNA was undetectable within the assay limits.

     <span>
      (56)
     </span>
    </span>

     is remarkable in that its authors appear to hold,
simultaneously contradictory positions that approximate to those at the heart
of our current discord.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     On the one hand
    </span>
    <span>
     Petricciani and
Horaud
    </span>
    <span>
     view DNA and its threats in biologic products in terms of
    </span>
    <span>
     “DNA dragons,”
    </span>
    <span>
     stating that “
    </span>
    <span>
     many
of us believe that we can now see the DNA dragons for what they are: real
myths.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     On the other
hand, this expression of “belief” appears tempered by its sandwiching between
more factual descriptions of the state of science on this topic. This
declaration of belief seems to have been precipitated by work bemoaningly cited
as demonstrating that an inefficient extraction procedure grossly
underestimated the amount of DNA in a biological sample, with the assertion,
appropriately, that “
    </span>
    <span>
     if tests for DNA are to be required, the results should be meaningful
rather than fanciful. In other words, the numerical values reported should not
be presented simply to provide comfort to regulatory authorities that risk has
been reduced, but they should have scientific credibility and be biologically
meaningful.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     Petricciani and
Horaud concede that
    </span>
    <span>
     “Nevertheless, it also is clear that more needs to be done to achieve a
final resolution of the DNA issue. Complex problems are not solved easily or
quickly, especially when there is an emotional element overlaid onto scientific
issues.”
    </span>
    <span>
     They call for an international group with broad
regulatory, industrial, and academic representation to answer questions,
including:
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     <span>
      ·
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     “Is
residual cellular DNA a practical and realistic risk, or simply a theoretical
concern?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     <span>
      ·
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     What
range of cellular DNA levels should be considered essentially risk-free?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     <span>
      ·
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     What
levels of cellular DNA should be considered acceptable as an impurity in
biological products?”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     In the span of
some 30 years and with advances in modRNA and lipid nanoparticle technology,
these questions remain as relevant today as in 1995. Most concerning is that
Petricciani and Horaud’s motivation in calling for an international group
appears to reach a foregone conclusion (theirs) rather than conduct healthy
scientific discourse or consider opposing arguments:
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     “The time is long overdue for
sanity to return to the issue of residual cellular DNA in biological products,
and for DNA to be treated as a simple impurity rather than as a monster. A
conference such as the one proposed above would provide a mechanism to achieve
that goal.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     Petricciani and
Horaud may well have been correct in their assessment of risks associated with
residual DNA resulting from the vaccine technology of the 1990s. But while technology
has progressed with innovations in modRNA and LNPs over 30 years, we have not
progressed in our ability to grapple with “[c]
    </span>
    <span>
     omplex problems
    </span>
    <span>
     [that]
    </span>
    <span>
     are not solved easily or
quickly, especially when there is an emotional element overlaid onto scientific
issues.”
    </span>
    <span>
     The time is indeed “long overdue for sanity to return
to the issue of residual [cellular] DNA” and that FDA’s detailed answers to the
detailed questions posed here, devoid of over-simplification, obfuscation, and
thinly veiled accusations of misinformation, will “
    </span>
    <span>
     provide
a mechanism to achieve that goal.”

     Dr. Marks’ letter
makes two statements concerning the plausibility of chromosomal integration of
residual DNA, arguing that since access to the nucleus is unlikely, integration
is even less likely:
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     “On first principle, it is quite implausible that the
residual small DNA fragments located in the cytosol could find their way into
the nucleus through the nuclear membrane present in intact cells and then be
incorporated into chromosomal DNA.”
    </span>
    <span>
     (his footnote 2 citing
    </span>
    <span>
     <span>
      (57)
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     )
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     “Regarding concern for possible integration of the residual
DNA fragments into reproductive cells: Please see the response to the first
question above regarding the implausibility that the minute amounts of small
DNA fragments present could find their way into the nucleus of these cells.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     These assertions
of the implausibility of genomic insertion by residual DNA rely solely on the
one reference cite by Dr. Marks as footnote 2
    </span>
    <span>
     <span>
      (57)
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     , a chapter in a textbook by Cooper,
    </span>
    <span>
     “The
Cell: A Molecular Approach.”
    </span>
    <span>
     The author’s preface reads (emphasis added):
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     “The goals and distinguishing features of The Cell, however, remain
unchanged from the first edition. The Cell continues to be a

    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     The chapter cited describes the fundamental properties
of the nuclear membrane, whose properties are the basis for the assertion as to
im
    </span>
    <span>
     plausibility of insertion.
    </span>
    <span>
     It does not
discuss the plausibility of nuclear entry or genomic insertion of residual DNA,
nor would such a basic introductory undergraduate text be expected to do so.
     <a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>
     However, from
the same basic text book cite by Dr. Marks, another chapter entitled
    </span>
    <span>
     “The Nucleus during Mitosis”
    </span>
    <span>
     <span>
      (58)
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     renders meaningless the suggestion of
    </span>
    <span>
     “first principle”
    </span>
    <span>
     implausibility
of DNA entry by describing how the nuclear membrane breaks down during mitosis,
thus plausibly providing access of residual DNA to chromosomal DNA. The chapter
states:
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     “A unique feature of the nucleus is that it disassembles and re-forms
each time most cells divide. At the beginning of mitosis, the chromosomes
condense, the nucleolus disappears, and the
    </span>
    <span>
     nuclear envelope breaks down
    </span>
    <span>
     , resulting in
    </span>
    <span>
     the
release of most of the contents of the nucleus into the cytoplasm
    </span>
    <span>
     .”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>

     ) for the
ability of endogenous LINE-1 to effect reverse transcription, and possible
insertion comes from the work led by Dr. Rudolf Jaenisch from the Whitehead
Institute, MIT and the National Cancer Institute, and funded partly by NIH.
(Zhang et al.,
    </span>
    <span>
     <span>
      (83)
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     ) Noting in their introduction, detection of non-retroviral
RNA viral sequences into the genomes of many vertebrates, Zhang et al. studied cell
lines and patient-derived tissues and found evidence for reverse-transcription
of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and genomic integration by a LINE-1 mechanism. This
could result, possibly by template switching, in the production of human-viral
mRNA chimeric transcripts and raising the prospect of novel proteins.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     In a subsequent
work, the same group reported genomic integration of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA mediated
by LINE-1 associated reverse transcription into human cell lines infected with
virus,

controverting the premise that “
    </span>
    <span>
     our cells do not have the enzyme necessary to get RNA back into DNA.”
    </span>
    <span>
     This was not
observed for cells transfected with viral RNA. The authors point out a number
of limitations to extrapolating their finding to conclude that this would not
occur with modRNA vaccines. Firstly, these studies were performed in cell lines
and not animals or humans. Secondly, their study achieved transfection using
lipofectamine rather than LNPs. Thirdly, the RNA sequence in the study was
nucleocapsid and not spike protein. Another important difference was in the
sequences of the untranslated regions, the use of N1-methyl pseudouridine and
the use of codon of optimization. The findings of Zhang et al. have been
challenged, and discussed further by two of the works’ coauthors.

     <span>
      (85)
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     Many of these limitations
were absent in the paper by Alden et al.,
    </span>
    <span>
     <span>
      (86)
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     who reported that BNT162b2 mRNA was reverse transcribed
into DNA within six hours after human liver cell line cells were exposed to
vaccine
    </span>
    <span>
     in vitro
    </span>
    <span>
     . This finding dispels another argument made by the
    </span>
    <span>
     2021 WHO
guideline on mRNA vaccines
    </span>
    <span>
     <span>
      (71)
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     to dismiss the need for integration studies:
    </span>
    <span>
     “Further,
the design of candidate mRNA vaccines should be considered so that they do not
include specific RNA-binding sites for primers required for the reverse
transcriptase to initiate transcription.”
    </span>
    <span>
     (p47/66)
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     Alden et al.
also reported that the vaccine increased distribution of LINE-1 protein in the
nucleus. The effect may not be due to the primary components of the Pfizer
vaccine, but rather to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a process-related impurity,
as Zhang et al.,
    </span>
    <span>
     <span>
      (84)
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     suggested that
dsRNA, known to induce innate immune responses, could induce endogenous LINE-1
expression. They further noted “
    </span>
    <span>
     that
    </span>
    <span>
     therapeutic mRNAs should be designed to avoid unwanted dsRNA (secondary)
structures.”
    </span>
    <span>
     Since dsRNA is a process-related impurity, variability
between lots could contribute to variable vaccine reactions.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     Another reason why the premise that
    </span>
    <span>
     “our cells do not have the enzyme
necessary to get RNA back into DNA”
    </span>
    <span>
     is untenable because reverse transcriptase may be
expressed by genes from
    </span>
    <span>
     Human
endogenous retroviruses (HERVs). HERVS are ancient retroviral genomic
integrations estimated to account for about 8% of the human genome and possibly
involved in a number of diseases including cancer, autoimmune, and
neurodegenerative disease.

    <span>
     <span>
      (87)
     </span>

     HERVs related genes
may be upregulated or activated by environmental factors such as viruses,

     for DNA vaccines is instructive. The document
discusses (p18/25) the fractions of naked DNA entering cells, entering the
nucleus, inserting into DNA, inserting at a key location, leading to a low
probability of tumorigenesis, borne out, at least partly, in some studies. The
document continues to discuss circumstances where integration studies might be

    </span>
    <span>
     However, alternative formulations or administration devices such as
co-inoculation of a plasmid encoding a growth promoting factor, or
electrostimulation, can lead to an increased potential for integration of
plasmid DNA, and an investigation of the potential integration of the plasmid
DNA in vivo into the host’s chromosomes should form part of the nonclinical
safety testing of a DNA vaccine.
    </span>

     Integration studies may not be necessary for a plasmid DNA vaccine if
prior information on a similar plasmid, with the same mode of administration

    <span>
     Dr. Marks
stated:

     “The specification for the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines for residual DNA
following DNAse treatment results in the presence of DNA fragments at a
quantity that is less than three orders of magnitude lower than the quantity of
the RNA dose by weight. This has been determined (and continues to be
determined during production of lots) with a validated quantitative PCR assay.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     The guidelines
do not speak of residual DNA limits in terms of their proportion to the amount
of RNA, indeed it is unclear why this ratio would be helpful, as surely any
risk associated with of DNA would be independent of the amount of RNA.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     The EMA do
appear to regard this ratio as useful for specification purposes, confirming
    </span>
    <span>
     <span>
      (116)
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     that the
    </span>
    <span>
     “limit for residual DNA in
Comirnaty active substance is 330ng DNA/mg RNA. This equates to &lt;10 ng DNA
per adult dose (30 micrograms RNA) of Comirnaty.”
    </span>
    <span>
     This computes to a ratio of 3030:1 of RNA to DNA by weight,
consistent with Dr. Marks’ statement that the “
    </span>
    <span>
     presence of DNA fragments
    </span>
    <span>
     […]

     Wang et al., showed
     that electroporation could increase plasmid
tissue levels in mice by six- to 34-times and the level of plasmid associated
with genomic DNA. In this example, DNA limits might be reduced by a factor of
between six and 34.

      Question 91:

      The statement
is misleading because qPCR underestimates the amount of residual DNA
     </span>
    
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     It is well
known that a qPCR method underestimates the amount of residual DNA. Moderna’s
2018 US Patent 10,077,439 B2 titled “
    </span>
    <span>
     Removal of DNA fragments in mRNA production process”
    </span>
    <span>
     explains:
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     “Quantitative PCR is often
applied to measure the residual DNA but it only detects the DNA molecules that
contain both qPCR primers thus does not measure all other smaller DNA molecules
that are partially digested.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     Just as UV and
fluorescence methods detect small and large fragments of RNA, they can be used similarly
for DNA, especially for fragments substantially smaller than the amplicon
length used in PCR. The amount of DNA estimated by these methods can exceed the
amount estimated by qPCR by multiples of tens or hundreds. The use of UV
absorbance at 250 nm to method to estimate plasmid quantity is referred to in a
2021 WHO guideline.

    <span>
     <span>
      (63)

     is linked to a concern that a functional DNA sequence may
integrate into the genome: (excerpted):”

     Indeed, the 10

     and noted that the

    <span>
     <span>
      (48)
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     may have been based, partly on the notion that the
    </span>
    <span>
     “local
response to plasmid DNA inoculation is that cells take up the plasmid and then
express the immunogen(s) encoded in the DNA vaccine and/or the nucleic acid is
degraded by normal molecular mechanisms.”
    </span>
    <span>
     (p14/54) This
degradation may have been considered to be more rapid for naked DNA shorter
than 200 bp. These mitigating factors cannot be assumed to apply to residual
DNA that could be encapsulated and protected by LNPs,(see p21/66 in

    <span>
     <span>

    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     The 2007 FDA
guidance on plasmid vaccines articulates a principle that is applicable to
modRNA vaccines:
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     “If the DNA sequence of the
insert gene and/or backbone vector of a DNA vaccine are changed, we recommend
that you consult with CBER to discuss whether the nature and/or magnitude of
the change(s) warrant the conduct of additional preclinical studies and/or the
submission of a new IND. You should provide to CBER a description of the
changes in manufacturing process and the results from preclinical safety
evaluations of the new (modified) DNA vaccine.”

     The red boxes show that three sequences were not
disclosed to the EMA: 1) SV40-promoter-enhancer-ori, 2) SV40 poly(A) signal; 3)
HSV-TK poly(A) signal. These are all regulatory sequences. There are two other
features of note:

     The AmpR promoter which is a regulatory
sequence required for the expression of the antibiotic resistance gene needed
for production of the plasmid, is missing in the Pfizer version.

     Software, such as Snapgene, generates these
plasmid maps within seconds of loading the sequence, showing all the sequence
elements, as was the case in the McKernan version. It appears that using this software
for the three undisclosed sequences to be absent from the Pfizer version would
have likely have required editing of the generated map by the selection of a
particular element and using the “delete” function to delete it.

     , EMA confirmed that:

      “an SV40 sequence is
present in the DNA plasmid starting material of Comirnaty and its adapted
vaccines, including Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5.”

     EMA further noted:
     <i>
      “The full DNA sequence of the
plasmid starting material was provided in the initial marketing authorisation
application for Comirnaty. The MAH
     </i>
     [Marketing Authorization Holder]
     <i>
      did
not specifically highlight the SV40 sequence, as it was considered to be a
non-functional part of the plasmid. They have since clarified this information
in response to questions raised by EMA.”
     </i>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     It appears from this response that Pfizer’s
non-disclosure of these sequences was a purposeful rather than an inadvertent
act, having at some point conducted what amounts to a risk assessment regarding
this sequence that had not been disclosed to EMA because it “
     <i>
      considered
     </i>
     [the
SV40 enhancer-promoter sequence]

guidances for plasmid-based DNA vaccine cannot be applied to modRNA vaccines

misleading disclosure.

     Moderna revealed that these adducts result from aldehyde
formation related to impurities in LNP raw materials. The formation of adducts
may stall ribosomal translation, inactivating the entire mRNA molecule. Adducts
could be avoided by control of the manufacturing process and by using “aldehyde
sinks” such as Tris as buffers instead of the more common PBS (phosphate
buffered-saline).

tertiary amine–based LNP lipids can oxidize to form reactive aldehydes that

     In October 2021, Pfizer changed the buffer in their
pro-vaccine product from PBS to Tris, ostensibly to make the cold storage
requirements less onerous. FDA authorized this switch based on bench top
analytical rather than animal or human trial comparability. Although Moderna
had described (see above) the role of buffer on lipid adduct formation, this
was not widely known or described to VRBPAC.

     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     describing the advantages of
using Tris buffer compared with PBS. The main advantage, different from those
given by Moderna but with the same end result, is that the Tris prevents the
mRNA strand from folding in a certain way that would otherwise impair its
translation. The patent application also describes other modifications to the
composition of the LNP buffer solution that along with the Tris, alter the
stability of LNPs.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     It is difficult to understand why, given the formation of
the folded mRNA structures, this sort of process (“Process 3”) change would be
suspected of affecting safety and effectiveness and therefore trigger
biological comparability studies.

     Even more concerning is that BioNTech’s patent

    <span>
     the formulation change on October
29 2021 based on the premise that the new buffer would improve stability and
storage cold requirements with no mention that the molecular form of the mRNA

     </span>

     modRNA pro-vaccines. Since the spike proteins of the BA.4 and BA.5
variants are identical,
    </span>
    <span>
     <span>
      (146)
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     these vaccines are said to be “bivalent” because they contain modRNA encoding
for the spike proteins of the Wuhan and BA4/5 variants.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     The term
bivalent is a misnomer. Moderna revealed at the Sept 1st ACIP meeting
    </span>
    <span>
     <span>
      (142,147)
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     that their bivalent vaccine elicits the formation of novel spike protein
heterotrimers to produce a superior immunological response. This occurs because
the modRNA for each variant is loaded into the same LNPs. Transfected cells
then produce spike protein monomers of each type, which then aggregate into
trimers. Four trimers are possible: homotrimers for each of the Wuhan or BA4/5
variants, plus heterotrimers containing either two Wuhan monomers plus one
BA4/5 monomer, or one Wuhan monomer plus two BA4/5 monomers.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     Thus, the two
heterotrimers are entirely novel. Since they have novel chemistry and pharmacology
(according to Moderna), they may also have a novel yet untested toxicology. Based
on EMA documents, it is likely that the same occurs for the Pfizer bivalent
vaccine.

     In March 2022, contemplating that updated
versions of the original COVID-19 pro-vaccines would be needed, FDA modified
its guidelines for the issuance of EUA.
    </span>
    <span>
     <span>
      (149)
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     The update stated:
    </span>
    <span>
     “FDA expects that much of
the manufacturing process and controls, as well as the facilities for vaccine
production, for the modified COVID-19 vaccine will be identical to that of the
prototype COVID-19 vaccine.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     Producing these bivalent products
requires significant changes in manufacturing that go well beyond their
expectations of manufacturing comparability with the original versions. Thus,
for Pfizer, the production of their bivalent product should constitute “Process
4,” and for Moderna, “Process 2.”
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     As we reported,
    </span>
    <span>
     <span>
      (150)
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     at a meeting between the React19 vaccine
injury group and FDA on December 14, 2022, FDA acknowledged that heterotrimer
formation is possible with the bivalent vaccines, but claimed that just because
heterotrimers may display different antigen properties from homotrimers, their
toxicological properties would likely be the same. Despite undertaking to
provide further information, this was not forthcoming.

     A particular challenge has been
to model the binding of the viral spike protein which mediates cell entry,
particularly its interactions with the ACE2 receptor. Jiang et al. noted:

     “The predicted 29 amino acid
residues of ACE2 that interact with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding
domain (RBD) vary between human ACE2 and mouse or rat ACE2. Therefore, wildtype
mice and rats show lower SARS-CoV-2 infection rate and mild symptoms compared
to what is seen in humans. Small animal models that recapitulate human COVID-19
disease are urgently needed for better understanding the transmission and

     conducted structural and functional modeling studies in several species with
the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein, and the three main proteins with which it acts: ACE2
receptor, TMPRSS2 and furin. While TMPRSS2 and furin are largely conserved
between species, the sequence of ACE2 is more variable, influencing spike
protein binding. Of the species studied, macaque, ferrets and hamster appeared
most suitable to study the effects of anti-SARSCov-2 antibodies and small
molecule inhibitors of the spike-ACE2 interaction. Rats, along with rabbits,
Guinea pigs, mice, were determined not to constitute a suitable model. The
authors suggested that transgenic animals expressing human ACE2 would likely
provide useful for models of viral entry. Both mouse and rat models expressing
human ACE2 have been developed.

     Clearly both Pfizer and Moderna understood the importance of

     However. since some toxic or genotoxic effects of COVID-19
mRNA vaccines may be related to the distribution of expressed spike protein,
likely dependent in part on ACE2 binding, similar considerations of an
ACE2-relevant model should also apply to t

     Biodistribution refers to the physical location of a
drug, tracer, or intact LNP within a biological system. It depends on
circulation, the protein corona, vascular permeability, and reticular
endothelial system (RES) uptake but does not indicate cell entry. Transfection
is the process of delivering nucleic acids, such as modRNA. It requires both
cellular uptake and endosomal release. In contrast, gene expression involves
translating the modRNA into the target protein, such as the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein. This process depends on the intact modRNA, active ribosomes, and
protection from degradation. It is important to recognize that the inherent
instability of LNPs, combined with degradation, opsonization, and various
biological barriers, can cause modRNA shearing, premature release, or even LNP
disassembly, which can significantly reduce their therapeutic effectiveness.

     Limited non-clinical PK studies were performed with
modRNA vaccine prototypes whose compositions differed from the candidate
COVID-19 modRNA vaccines for which no studies were reported.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     The principal difference between the tested and
candidate vaccines was in the sequence of the modRNA payload carried by the
LNPs. Other differences are largely unknown in terms of
    </span>
    <span>
     method
of manufacture, nucleoside modification, codon optimization, amounts and types
of impurities and contaminants. Small differences in LNP composition,

     A major goal in conducting PK studies is to
characterize the distribution, production, and persistence of the spike
protein, as these factors presumably relate to the extent and type of immune
response it will trigger. Spike PK properties depend on modRNA PK and
expression characteristics, which in turn depend on LNP PK properties.
Understanding the PK and expression properties of the spike protein, modRNA,
and LNPs is essential, as discussed by Vervaeke et al.

reason why regulators have accepted PK studies involving LNP vaccines carrying non-candidate

     “Because biodistribution and retention is a property of the LNP rather

reaches further than did Moderna’s nonclinical review: “
    </span>
    <span>
     The distribution, toxicity, and genotoxicity
associated with mRNA vaccines formulated in LNPs are driven primarily by the
composition of the LNPs and, to a lesser extent, by the biologic activity of
the antigen(s) encoded by the mRNA.” (p

mRNA being the sole property of the LNP:
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     “It is biologically plausible
that the distribution of the mRNA vaccine is determined by the lipid
nanoparticle content, whereas the influence of the mRNA itself is considered
very limited. Therefore, it is acceptable that the biodistribution study was performed
with the same lipid nanoparticles containing another mRNA (i.e. mRNA-1647).“

     (p47/169)

     LNPs constitute a delivery method for
modRNA, much like a buffer solution in a hypodermic syringe is a system for
delivering drugs. The initial phases of distribution must certainly be highly
dependent on the properties of the delivery system (physicochemical properties
such as particle size, payload, composition etc. for LNPs, buffer composition
needle size and administration rate for the syringe). The general chemistry of
mRNA will likely determine to a large degree its general distributive
properties. However, a close inspection of Moderna’s study reveals that
although PK parameters for six different CMV mRNAs

applicability of PK studies conducted with non-candidate versions of modRNA
vaccines, it affects the relevance of most other non-clinical studies where
these materials are used as test articles. These submissions only provide

tightly, perhaps unsurprisingly. In terms of the half-life of elimination from
the injection site, the values for the six mRNA constructs cluster around 15
hours. For the proximal lymph nodes, they cluster around 35 hours. Accordingly,
the time for 90% elimination is approximately 2-5 days, corresponding to CDC’s
“few days” (

these tissues there appears to be greater between-construct variability in PK
parameters. In the spleen, the half-life is longer for all constructs, up to 83
hours for the gH construct, corresponding to a time to 90% elimination of
approximately over 11 days.

     Any toxic or genotoxic effects of COVID-19
mRNA vaccines may potentially be related to the expressed spike protein. The
distribution and kinetics of protein expression is therefore important to
understand. As the spike protein is known to interact with the ACE-2 receptor,
distribution, thus the use of animals in toxicity or genotoxicity whose ACE-2
is similar to that of a human is vital.

     Favorable supportive data, although not
independently decisive, certainly adds confidence to a favorable risk
assessment. Such confidence must be tempered by the sometimes-remote comparability
of the mRNA products tested to the authorized or approved product in terms of
the mRNA sequence, LNP composition, method of manufacture, nucleoside
modification, codon optimization, amounts and types of impurities and
contaminants.

genotoxicity is associated with high doses and chronic administration (≥1000
mg/kg/day). Since the amount of ALC-0159 excipient in the finished product is
low (50 μg/dose), its clearance is high and only two administrations of the

these findings, (p50/169) the EMA noted that non-genotoxic effects observed in

micronucleated erythrocytes and could: affect clearance of micronucleated cells
from the blood; elicit hyperthermia, increase splenic inflammation, and disturb
erythropoiesis (lower reticulocyte count, higher red blood cell distribution
width). Although the study details appear unavailable (see

effects on erythropoiesis are unclear, but a lower reticulocyte count seen in
the toxicological studies appears consistent with decreased numbers of
polychromatic erythrocytes noted in the luciferase genotoxicity study. However,
it is unclear from the limited detail available, how reductions in
reticulocytes and polychromatic cells are mechanistically related to an
increase in micronucleated cells.

(204) Please provide full details of all signals generated by EBDM, including where the threshold is set to EB05&gt;1, and the RGPS procedure within the Empirica software is used to adjust for masking, using the ER05&gt;1 criteria?

     The
authors synthesized a pool of peptides whose sequences were predicted by +1
shifts of the reading frame for spike protein in vaccinal BNT162b2 modRNA. Murine
spleen and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were taken after vaccination
with the Pfizer or Astra-Zeneca products and exposed to these frameshift peptides
in an
     <i>
      in vitro
     </i>
     assay of T cell function. Cells from mice or humans
previously vaccinated with the Pfizer but not the Astra-Zeneca product
responded in this assay. According to the press release about a third of the
people responded in this way, indicating that they had “seen” antigens
resembling those peptides before.

     </i>
    </span>

   <p>
    <span>
     The paper also discussed how frameshifting would
likely elicit a family of chimeric proteins consisting of portions of in-frame
and out of frame amino acid sequences.
    </span>
    <span>
     The authors showed that
frameshifting was likely to occur at sites rich in
     <span>
      N1-methylpseudouridine, engineered into the RNA to produce the
“nucleoside modified” RNA (modRNA) to evade innate immune attack. Since the
viral-vector DNA Astra-Zeneca vaccine did not contain this modification, no
evidence of exposure to frameshift proteins was detected in the cells of mice
or people given this product. Frameshifting in a model system occurred in
approximately 10% of ribosomal reads which could be reduced by limiting the
extent of N1-methylpseudouridylation at particular loci.
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     The
authors concluded that
     <i>
      “these data suggest that vaccination with 1-methyl.
mRNA can elicit cellular immunity to peptide antigens produced by +1 ribosomal
frameshifting in both major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-diverse people and
MHC-uniform mice.”

make the proteins we want for an immune response without inadvertently making
other proteins as well. The safety concern for future mRNA medicines is that
mis-directed immunity has
      <b>

      With this and similar statements, the authors
state in the paper that
      <i>
       “Although there is no evidence that frameshifted
products in humans generated from BNT162b2 vaccination are associated with
adverse outcomes.
      </i>
      ” This statement appears to be based on the observation that
none of the 21 subjects providing samples had “
      <i>
       reported undue effects as a
result of vaccination.”
      </i>
      It is
unclear how it is possible to draw any conclusions about the safety
implications of the frameshifted proteins given that:
     </span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>

adverse outcomes constitutes a selection bias.

      The stated premise for the study was: “
      <i>
       So
far, no study has investigated the fundamental question of whether modified
ribonucleotides can affect the maintenance of the correct reading frame during
translation of a synthetic transcript.”
      </i>
      If these authors were able to
predict the existence of frameshifted proteins, why were Pfizer’s scientists
unable to do so? Certainly, the possibility of
      <i>
       “cryptic proteins”
      </i>
      being
translated from alternative out of frame open reading frames was known to the
co-founder of Moderna in a 2016 paper. (p326 of

      Although this study involved the Pfizer
vaccine, due to the involvement of the same nucleoside modification deployed in
the Moderna product, frameshifting is also likely for that product.

   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     <span>
      Furthermore, the covalent lipid–RNA adducts
and truncated RNA contained within the LNPs reduce the effective mRNA dose
available for translation. These modifications can also perturb ribosome
progression, potentially also contributing to ribosomal frameshifting (~8%
observed in Mulroney et al.), which may generate incomplete or altered
proteins. At the same time, residual LNP components and misprocessed RNA
fragments can potentially increase cellular stress and immunogenicity.

      Together, these effects effectively narrow
the therapeutic window of mRNA-LNP vaccines, creating a disconnect between
nominal “dose” and functional antigen delivery.

      The evidence for the elicitation by modRNA
COVID-19 vaccines of uncharacterized frameshift proteins represents a developmental
and regulatory failure to ask fundamental questions that could affect the
safety and effectiveness of, and confidence in, these products. This failure

a lower standard whereby “
     <i>
      based on the totality of the scientific evidence
available, it is reasonable to believe that the product may be effective.”
     </i>
     The “totality” standard allows the FDA to consider evidence of a lower type or
procedural or statistical quality not normally considered in a conventional

     The safety

     <i>

     “ Uncertainties,
irregularities, or deviations from normal accepted practice in the
manufacturing process represent “potential risks” FDA was required to consider.
It was not necessary to prove that DNA contamination, the SV40 sequence, or
frameshifted proteins did caused harm, the mere fact of these phenomena
constituted an uninvestigated potential risk FDA was legally required to
consider when granting the EUAs.

    <span>
     <span>
      (222)
     </span>
    </span>
    <span>
     is the view that LNPs as passive
excipients do not reflect their demonstrated biological activity, adjuvant-like
properties, or unpredictable biodistribution. Regulatory frameworks must evolve
to treat LNPs as active, bioactive, transfection agents, subject to the same
level of scrutiny as other pharmacologically active agents.

     We hope
that the questions posed here will allow us to understand the potential harms associated
with the modRNA pro-vaccines in a way that begins to restore the public trust
in the scientific process and health institutions, by engaging in a process of
introspection and improvement of regulatory processes and decision-making.

products ever deployed. Pfizer’s recently retired head of vaccine research, Dr.

  charged one of its expert committees with the task of drafting a general USP
